In West's novel, sexual adventure is likened to colonial adventure; the mother's Jamaican travels and her attempt to direct her husband's sexual attention away from the "redundant fertility of these tropical climes, and the bad habits which slavery introduces” situates colonial sexual conquest centrally within the narrative (2: 140). Mrs. Williams implies that in addition to the “bad habit” of rape, slavery lures Englishmen away from English domestic marriage. And, like many contemporary texts, her novel associates colonial sexuality with libertinage. When Mrs. Williams's childhood friend, Mrs. Herbert, welcomes her to Jamaica, she prepares her for Mr. Williams's sexual transgressions by locating them within the culture of the plantocracy: “His faults,' said she, ‘are no more than the common vices of the island. The planters, generally speaking, countenance each other in irregularities, at which an English libertine would blush” (2: 140). Colonial sexuality exceeds the excesses, even, of libertinage. The condemnation of libertinage is sustained throughout West's book; Maria's boarding-school friend marries an aristocratic rake because her father's gaming spirit and overindulgence prevent him from exerting parental moral guidance. Mrs. Williams tells the story of her own marriage to an unfeeling libertine as a cautionary tale; her personal tribulations are what account for her maternal authority." And Mrs. Williams's ideal home could not be more different from the Jamaica plantation. It is in the English countryside, where female virtue can be protected and cultivated. West's novel illustrates a governing theme of this book: eighteenth-century British literature figured colonial otherness as a force that would underwrite financial stability as it undermined social hierarchy and infected or adulterated a feminized English virtue. Mrs. Williams sets her virtue against colonial vice in order to secure financial stability for herselfIntroduction and daughter. The battle of English domesticity and colonial vice catalyzes Mrs. Williams's travel and the closure of the novel. For instance, Mrs. Williams tells her daughter, “I superintended the concern of my family, and by introducing a degree of order and oeconomy, I rescued from profusion that competence, which is now adequate to our support” (2: 144). The colonial economy subsidizes their domestic economy: profits from the Jamaican plantation account for the mother's wealth, are enablers of the mother's mobility, and serve as a negative model used by Mrs. Williams in her moral instruction. Maria's mother tells her, “I felt alike unwilling to expose your constitution to the baleful influences of the climate, or your tender mind to be vitiated by the no less pernicious examples of pride, cruelty, and luxury, which is unhappily prevalent in [that] spot” (2: 143). But her guardianship of purity is limited, for she is eager to expose her daughter to such vices through the safe medium of narration, where Maria could learn by example and be spared the dangers of propinquity. The reader is meant to feel that when the right kinds of stories dramatize cultural difference and domesticity, traditional social structures can be maintained and women's virtue will be preserved. The equation of female virtue with national virtue was certainly not rare, especially in the late eighteenth century. Ten years before writing her novel, and in dubious celebration of her friend's impending nuptials, Jane West wrote a poem, “To a Friend on her Marriage, 1784,” regretting the bride's inevitable loss of power: “MARRIED, poor soul! your empire's over” (1). In a concise marriage of the discourses of domesticity and empire, West uses the language of empire to wax cautious about the empire of love. But though the poem derogates marriage, West ultimately argues that domestic virtue is the purest power any English lady could hope to attain. Her poem, like her novel, instructs. She misrepresents her allegiances by beginning with a list of marriage's liabilities and lost profits:Adventures in Domesticity Adieu the duteous kneeling lover; Farewell, eternally farewell, The glory of the stately belle; The plumed head, the trailing gown, The crowded ball, the busy town, For one short month are yours, and then Must never be resumed again. (2-8) West makes the familiar move of pitting dynamic urbanity against the steadiness of rural life, but most important is that her friend's ability to command material gratification depends upon her active presence in the marriage market. As an unmarried woman with untapped sexual resources, she rules the empire of love, complete with imperialist pomp and plumage. Her poem thus opens the domestic to exploration, thereby politicizing the feminine realm of domestic virtue. But once her friend marries, the power dynamic reverses and she becomes a laboring drudge: “No longer, ‘Madam, hear my vows,'/ But ‘Mend this ragged wristband, spouse' (11-12). Moreover, her mobility becomes delineated by the domestic sphere. While the husband is free to circulate in public, the wife's domain has shrunk to the province of her home: “I mean to call upon a friend, Do you your household cares attend.” “Mayn't I go too, my dear?” — “Oh, Lord! What, married women go abroad! Your horse is lame, the roads are rough Besides, at home you've work enough.” (13-18)Introduction And in the domain of the home, the married woman, as Daniel Defoe predicted one hundred years earlier, is nothing better than an "upper servant.” Not only does she no longer command servitude, but she is herself commanded to serve. And her mobility is restricted, for married women must plant the seeds of virtue in the soil of the (landed) English country home. But West turns regret for loss of power over the empire of love into celebration of power over domestic virtue. Still using the language of empire and commerce, West applauds the “talismanic power” of the “nuptial hour” that “possesse[s]” women who "grow enamoured of the change” (23, 24, 26). Her friend's "breast,” no longer marker of sexual capital, now symbolizes domestic virtue: “Her breast each social virtue warms” (41). And her faithful subject is no longer the “dutious kneeling lover," but an “infant charge” (2, 53). Indeed, the power dynamic has completely reversed by the end of the poem; the dutiful wife “serves the master of her heart," working to secure his “[a]pproval” (58-59; my emphasis). Narrating the domestic scene in the language of colonial struggle, West closes the poem gratified with the power derived from domesticity's moral authority: Thy virtues shall secure the palm, Hymneal friendship's placid calm, And show to a too polished nation Example worthy imitation. (63-66) West's hymeneal to the "worth” of intact hymens recalls Maria William's journey to "the Temple of the Hymen” in Advantages of Education. In both texts, the fear of hymeneal transgressions are associated with and narrated in the language of colonialism. The vices of the “too polished nation” are those of aristocratic libertinage — the same vices she equatesAdventures in Domesticity with creolization in the novel. Mrs. Williams's stories of plantation sexual “luxury" (143) inculcate virtue and safeguard Maria from libertine assault. But West does not only contrast bourgeois domesticity with the concupiscent vices of the Caribbean." She posits bourgeois domesticity as the means by which England should dispossess itself of the vices of empire. Thus are the novel's sexual relations structurally built upon an economy of colonial sexual difference. Hence, colonial sexuality and the material benefits of colonial travel underwrite domestic female virtue in the English countryside. West sees domesticity as a panacea for social ills contracted through colonial commerce. Her faith in - and near fascination with — the ideological value of domesticity exemplifies this book's subject: eighteenth-century British literature responded to concerns about a changing English identity during a time of great international, colonial expansion by turning to domestic narratives. I understand domestic to mean both home and nation, and read the domestic home space as figured in close relation to the domestic nation. And because domesticity describes an ideology as much as it does a home or national life, we can examine how English domestic narratives were deployed in a wide range of literary texts to resolve political and cultural concerns about English identity. This book argues that England's literary imagination and national identity, increasingly built upon an economy of colonial difference, turned to the domestic as a sustained but shifting trope that promised but often failed to resolve anxiety about the contaminating vices of cultural others. Domesticity and colonialism have, for some time now, been hotbed topics for eighteenth-century scholars. American feminist critics like Jane Spencer and Nancy Armstrong challenged traditional literary history by arguing for the centrality of women writers and domesticity to the rise of the novel. Armstrong's reading of domesticity and the novel "links the history of British fiction to the empowering of theIntroduction middle classes in England through the dissemination of a new female ideal [in a way that] challenges existing histories of the novel. For one thing, it insists that the history of the novel cannot be understood apart from the history of sexuality" (Desire 9). Though the discourse of sexuality certainly underwrote domestic narratives, I contest Armstrong's claim that “domestic fiction unfolded the operations of human desire as if they were independent of political history” (9). Recent critics have begun to rethink the "separate spheres” theory as an adequate way to conceptualize the changing representation of British domestic identity. The separate spheres theory gendered public spaces and writing as masculine, and gendered private spaces and writing as feminine. “Modern institutional cultures,” according to Armstrong, “depend upon the separation of the political from 'the personal and ... produce and maintain this separation on the basis of gender — the formulation of masculine and feminine domains of culture” ("Some Call It Fiction” 920). Such a formulation of domesticity – while groundbreaking in its reconception of gender and ideology — has been shown to be problematic for several reasons. Primarily, it posits too narrow a view of domestic ideology. Specifically — and crucial to this study — the domestic home and the domestic nation mutually implicated each other in the project of articulating a coherent British identity. And, as critics like Felicity Nussbaum have shown, the ideological and legal importance attached to female virtue politicized the putatively private realm of the domestic home. Moreover, as we shall see in my discussion of abolitionist women poets, domesticity was deployed as a strategy to resolve anxieties about colonial trade. In writing about slaves, poets used domestic narratives to dramatize fears about colonialism's corrupting influence on English domestic virtue. Such literary moves testify to the politicization of the private sphere. Rethinking the separate spheres theory inAdventures in Domesticity relation to colonial discourse broadens our understanding of English domesticity. Recent postcolonial theory has usefully read out these discursive overlaps. Anne McClintock, for one, posits a methodology based upon discursive intersections: "race, gender, and class are not distinct realms of experience, existing in splendid isolation from each other” (Imperial 5). But in spite of this inherently feminist approach, many postcolonial critics, like Gayatri Spivak and Firdous Azim, have repeatedly taken issue with a British-American feminist model that, historically, has read subjectivity as solely predicated on Western gender. These critics focus primarily on the ways in which colonialism underwrote eighteenth- and nineteenth- century British discourse. Most famously, Spivak has claimed that Western feminist critics have done violence to literary history because an “isolationist admiration for the literature of the female subject in Europe and Anglo-America establishes the high feminist norm” that "reproduces the axioms of imperialism” (“Three,” 896). Thus the feminist and postcolonial camps have at once been in agreement with and at odds with one another. Of course it was Edward Said who initiated the rewriting of traditional metanarratives of English historiography and literary history by suggesting that it was colonialism and orientalist discourse, not solely Protestantism or the rise of the middle class, that shaped England's self- conception." Said's groundbreaking work has been widely criticized for failing to consider gender, and it is only recently that scholars have begun to combine feminist and postcolonial methodologies to read representations of women as central to the understanding of English narratives and colonial discourse." Perhaps because of this, throughout these lucid critiques, the role and tropes of domesticity have only just begun to be adequately understood in relation to English literature and colonialism.Introduction Why is it important to continue to rethink domesticity? First, because domesticity was central to England's self- conception. It is now a critical commonplace to consider colonialism in relation to English literature, but I want to further illuminate those considerations by broadening our understanding of domesticity: in order to think about England's relation to its colonies and to understand how England imagined itself in the eighteenth century, we need to extend our understanding of how writers deployed domestic narratives. True, colonialism shaped English discourse and undoubtedly influenced the way the English thought about family life and national identity, but representations of domesticity were so forceful that they often incorporated colonial relations into their narratives. English domesticity was often posited as a foil for colonial vice, but ideas about Englishness, creolité, and Africanness cross-fertilized one another. And domesticity was an elastic concept, able to interfuse cultural differences. Domestic discourse was deployed as a colonizing tactic; African and Caribbean cultures were called civilized or savage based in part on their domestic practices. But domestic discourse also swung back to England nuanced by racial ideology. Domestic narratives may have cannibalized tropes of colonial difference, but those tropes as certainly pushed at the boundaries of domestic discourse — as much from the inside as from the out. I read domesticity, then, as a dominant trope for thinking about the ways in which eighteenth-century England conceived of itself as a colonial nation. Examining, for instance, the image of the diseased woman in a colonial context, or tracking tropes of (racial, cultural, sexual) adulteration in British literature make visible one of the discursive connections between colonialism and domesticity: a growing, widespread fear that sexual, physical, and social infection would be imported from West India and Africa along with colonial goods. Often, the threat of adulteration was10 Adventures in Domesticity figured as a familial disruption in the text. These narrative ruptures suggest a concern with cultural purity that turned to the domestic narrative for stability. Persistent tropes of adulteration, female virtue, the passionate Creole, or the diseased but profitable other suggest that British literature imagined cultural mixing, in the early part of the century, as profitable, but became increasingly troubled by it toward the nineteenth century. In the first half of the eighteenth century, English readers devoured tales of colonial adventure that most often ended with betrayal and death. Wildly popular stories like Inkle and Yariko or Oronooko romanticized colonial conquest. But early adventure and romance stories, like Daniel Defoe's novels or travel narratives, also used the signs of colonial difference as a means of mobility and financial gain. By the end of the century, fictional portrayals of contact between cultural others seldom took place in exotic settings or on the frontier but mostly in English domestic settings. Moreover, international adventure and travel narratives, so popular at the beginning of the century, were being replaced by narratives of domestic travel or grand tours. Literarily, throughout the latter half of the century and into the nineteenth century, domestic travel was an important plot element in the novels of Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, Lawrence Sterne, Jane Austen, and many others. This sort of travel was, of course, considered to be more civilized, for it was intended to cultivate the virtues of the gentry or the bourgeoisie rather than to voyeuristically explore wild lands and exotic people. As colonial stories gradually became staged in England rather than in faraway places, colonial concerns — miscegenation, adulteration, cultural mixing — were no longer safely confined to the fictional adventures that took place “out there.” Rather, domestic fiction used colonial difference as fodder for stories about domestic rural English virtue and now focused on assimilating difference rather than celebrating it. Thus, viaIntroduction fiction and travel narrative, colonial people and culture were crossing the oceans to return "home.” The fictional and nonfictional homing of colonial difference made fuzzy distinctions between home and away, domestic and foreign. But as colonial contact increased, writers more frequently equated fears of cultural adulteration with the loss of female virtue. Because women were often portrayed as the bearers of civilization, they were viewed as especially susceptible to corruption or cultivation. Control of female sexuality was also viewed as a safeguard against miscegenation and, by extension, traditional race- and class- based hierarchies. Thus anxiety about racial and cultural mixing, both of which resulted from colonial trade and travel, was visible in literary representations of women and cultural others and in the changing meanings of domesticity. Further, many texts defined cultural difference in relation to reproduction and labor. The semantic correspondence between labor as work and labor as birth pains is central to many texts (like Defoe's Roxana, Austen's Mansfield Park, or many eighteenth-century travel narratives), and resonates importantly with its synonym: travail. Etymologically connected to travel, travail also signifies the pains of parturition, or labor. These semantic shadows reveal the relation between natural histories, novels, and political tracts in the formation of an ideology that divided up the world according to cultures that labored and cultures that consumed. In the long eighteenth century, a labor economy was a sexual economy, one based on cultural difference. Women of color labored and had exotic sex. English, white women consumed colonial products and came to be viewed as too elevated for nonreproductive sex. But these differences were often fluid, especially as the century wore on and ever more white Creoles returned to England newly wealthy from plantation profits. And the more troubling cultural miscegenation became, theAdventures in Domesticity more domestic narratives were deployed in an effort to figure a coherent domestic identity. Moreover, because there was a value set upon female virtue as safeguard for legitimacy and because narratives of fallen women, “marriage” narratives, and sexually charged “adventure” narratives were so popular in the literary marketplace, domesticity and sexuality were commercialized. Reading these literary and social changes reveals how race and class mixings came to be seen as a forbidden intermingling of bodies that would result in social evils ranging from cultural “infection" and the dispersal of property to illegitimate children to the destruction of the European “species.” To read these representational and narrative shifts is to remap the intersections among eighteenth-century British discourses on race, gender, domesticity, and Englishness. The five chapters in this book chart the nature of the changing relationship between colonialism and English domesticity by looking at the stories English writers told about themselves. Colonial contact transfigured the English concept of itself, and nowhere is that more evident than in its representation of domesticity. My first chapter offers a reading of Daniel Defoe's second adventure novel, Captain Singleton, from which I borrow my chapter title. I argue that Defoe manipulates the tropes of domestic and home in order to articulate emerging concerns about England's domestic identity as a developing commercial nation. Home and adventure were often bound up in the same colonizing project and converged most frequently in the literature of travel. Fictive accounts of adventurous travel, both as a material condition of and as a trope for social changes on the home front, proliferated during the first quarter of the century. In the early eighteenth century, novels and travel literature (themselves hybrid genres) represented cultural otherness as occasional, exotic, and often profitable influence on English identity. For example, characters in Daniel Defoe's CaptainIntroduction Singleton or Roxana dress up in oriental garb to their profit. Captain Singleton's "colonial masquerade” resolves the problem of how to absorb colonial and piratical wealth into the English economy as it allows him to come “home” to England after years of traveling and trading in Africa. In Captain Singleton, the pirates welcome cultural difference because the strategic use of disguise and “foreign” languages serve as a means of mobility and a source of financial gain. Defoe's narrative strategy also engages in a kind of literary masquerade because the text refuses to categorize itself (as a novel, autobiography, or travelogue) and because the story is narrated through the gaps and absences of the narrator's partial confessions. Similarly, Defoe capitalized on generic adulteration: his novels masqueraded as travel narratives, cashing in on the popularity of travel adventure stories. By mutually implicating home and adventure in one another, Defoe defies the idea that travel narratives, and hence textual experiences, are safe proxies for the dangerous urges to travel away from the moral epicenter of home. And by displacing the specifically sexualized threat of illegitimate travel and its close relative, colonial commerce, onto language, he subverts any claims to safety by the very telling of his tale. As with much of eighteenth-century British literature, the shifting meaning of domestic was paralleled by generic and narrative instabilities and ambiguities in literature concerned with articulating a British identity." Just as eighteenth-century British literature was preoccupied with questions and tropes of legitimacy and adulteration, writers were also engrossed by legitimate and adulterated language and genre. However categorized, Singleton also appreciates the value of an adventure story. He parleys his adventures into rare stories and disguises himself in what I name colonial masquerade: he returns to England a wealthy man who must speak another language and wear Persian garb in order to pass as a legitimate businessman. Singleton is sharply aware thatAdventures in Domesticity language has the power to "end [pirates'] Journals at the Gallows." Thus the question of how to marry colonial wealth to the British home is also, urgently, the question of how to narrate homely adventures without ending one's “Journal at the Gallows.” His colonial masquerade transports his adventures to a home in England and threatens the English countryside with piratical illegitimacy. Thus while the domestic narrative resolves the problem of how to absorb his ill-gotten booty into the English economy and allows him to come “home,” it shows that the image of legitimate English bourgeois domesticity is itself a masquerade. By the 1970s, cultural mixing is no longer predominantly represented as faraway pirate adventure tales but has moved, in several senses, to the domestic stage. Writers began to represent cultural difference as a force that could dangerously “infect” English traditions and creolize its domestic economy. In chapter 2, I argue that Richard Cumberland's sentimental play, The West Indian, resolved colonialism's anxieties by incorporating worry about Afro- Caribbean commerce and sexuality into its domestic plot. The eponymous hero, Belcour, is valued for his assimilation into an idealized, bourgeois identity. Cumberland's play personifies colonial wealth as a concupiscent Creole figure who must be tamed by a virtuous English lady in order to gain legitimation. Their domestic union promises to absorb colonial wealth into the English economy, and the lady who “enslaves" with her virtue guarantees unsullied, legitimate heirs. Reworking the trope of the passionate Creole into the manageable figure of domestic husband, the sentimental script effectively diffuses sexual danger and endorses patriarchy. Written in 1771 and performed regularly throughout the rest of the century, The West Indian is generally treated as a sentimental comedy and is usually not, despite its title, analyzed in terms of empire and race. But Cumberland's play turns upon the sexual conversion of Belcour (from passionate lover to domestic husband),Introduction 15 Stockwell's legitimate but hitherto unclaimed Creole son. Belcour's legitimization is dependent upon his marital choice and is symbolic of the relationship of England to its colonies: both Belcour and the colonies were viewed as needing sexual and cultural regulation. Cumberland narrates the romance with the language of commerce and insurrection, revealing the power of sentimental domesticity: it contains outside threats and normalizes men and women into subjects willing to be governed by virtue. Chapter 3 further develops the connection between colonial difference and domesticity. This chapter analyzes the way Anna Maria Falconbridge's Narrative of Two Voyages to the River Sierra Leone in the Years 1791 and 1792 (1794) draws on contemporary literary conventions as it negotiates the role of women within colonialism. Falconbridge dramatizes domesticity as a way to articulate colonial concerns, and she uses the female body as a marker of cultural difference. The domestic experiences of Falconbridge, one of a handful of women travel writers in the eighteenth century, were politicized when she published her narrative. Originally written as letters to a friend, the narrative was recast and published to recover money owed to her late husband by the Sierra Leone Company. To that end, she artfully lays open her personal affairs, capitalizing on her private domestic relations and the domestic relations of the colony. But in spite of publicizing her personal experiences, she often builds scenes of colonial contact around partial articulations. Specifically, Falconbridge, like many women travel writers, engages in a stylized femininity in order to politicize her domestic situation and to vocalize criticism about empire. She will write, for instance, that "severe modesty” prevents her from fully disclosing a scene about English prostitutes, a West African slave yard, or details about her marriages. These narrative gaps, like the absences in Defoe's novels, destabilize the idea of a seamless and coherent Enlightenment subject.16 Adventures in Domesticity In this and other ways, Falconbridge's narrative differs from travelogues written by men. Only in the past few decades has women's travel writing been considered a viable topic of academic study. Traditionally, critical consideration of travel literature focused on male travel writers, usually in the context of adventure, colonial travel, and pleasure tours, or in its generic relation to other forms of writing, like the novel. Such early studies of women's travel writing as there were concentrated on the nineteenth century and were often biographical and celebratory, featuring, as one critic has put it, the “eccentric Victorian spinster or the indomitable individual seeking ... escape from conventional women's roles" (Hahner, xx).14 As they explore the poetics of women's travel writing, these critics note that it differs from men's in at least one crucial way: the textual economy of women's travel writing is not an economy of sexual conquest. Sara Mills notes: “social conventions for conceptualizing imperialism ... [seem) to be as much about constructing masculine British identity as constructing a national identity per se” (3). Felicity Nussbaum and Ronald Hyam have argued that the West Indies, Africa, and the Orient were mapped out according to a kind of pornogeography. Nussbaum writes: “By the mid-eighteenth century, whole areas of the world were constructed as sexualized, as if to suggest that the world represented a human body with its genitals in the lower southern climes” (6). Hyam contends (in Empire and Sexuality: The British Experience), quite problematically, that imperial policies were shaped by the sexual urges of British men. His treatment has been criticized for being oversimplified and offensively antifeminist but, when read in conjunction with other accounts, it points to the perhaps obvious fact that colonial and imperial projects capitalized on the sexual and reproductive forces of women." It also suggests that knowledge of women's travel writing would help develop our picture of colonial sexual relations and ourIntroduction 17 understanding of the impact of colonialism on domestic narratives. Women's travel writing was not the only genre to exemplify the ways in which women's narratives dramatized colonial domesticity, opening the domestic to exploration and challenging stereotypes of women. In their absorption of colonial anxieties into domestic narratives, women travel writers resembled contemporary abolitionist poets who utilized sentimental domestic narratives to lobby for abolition of the slave trade. Their writing proposed that bourgeois domesticity could absorb and resolve colonial anxieties. Writers of many different genres, especially in the late eighteenth century, made this same discursive move. If, as Edward Said said, colonialsm haunted England's literary subconscious, domesticity ghosted colonialism. Domesticity was about both the English subject and the colonial specter — at once Jane Eyre and Bertha/ Antoinette Mason." Several decades after Falconbridge's travel, Jane Austen's (anti)heroine, Fanny Price, engages in a claustrophobic, endogamous marriage that safeguards the English estate, which had been threatened by the profligacy of a creolized, libertine eldest son. As with the other texts I have mentioned, Mansfield Park use a domestic narrative to manage colonial wealth and cultural difference. And as in Captain Singleton, Austen's heroic couple's greatest fears and desires are articulated as unspeakable absences. Chapter 4 argues that Austen's Mansfield Park represents class and race mixing as dangerous excesses that threaten to encroach upon the ordered world of the English countryside. The feminine ideal of the leisurely bourgeois woman is countered by sexually independent and physically vigorous women. The novel's concern with inappropriate speech disrupts the narration and threatens to damage virtue with the articulation of sexually charged transgression. Like many eighteenth- and early- nineteenth-century social histories, such as Edward Long's TheAdventures in Domesticity History of Jamaica, or General Survey of The Antient and Modern State of that Island: With Reflections on its Situations, Settlements, Inhabitants, Climate, Products, Commerce, Laws and Government (1774), Falconbridge's Narrative of Sierra Leone (1774), and William Cobbett's Rural Rides (1820), Austen's novel looks to the relationship between female sexuality and labor as a way to define cultural (and moral) difference. Fanny Price's triumphant return to Mansfield Park as Edmund Bertrum's future wife is a forceful endorsement of both patriarchal and imperial values that are based upon an ideology that fears the contaminating vices of cultural others whose difference is determined by the kind of labor (moral, sexual, physical, etc.) women perform. My conclusion focuses on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, a novel not typically read in relation to colonialism. Such a reading provides an apt conclusion to the book because we see in the text that colonial relations provided the discourse through which Dr. Frankenstein articulates his narrative of domestic monstrosity. We can read the novel as one that translates a vast colonial socioeconomic problem into a domestic narrative. When, for instance, Frankenstein opines that in his efforts to create a "new species,” he has neglected his familial responsibilities, he concludes that "if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Caesar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed” (59). Per this formulation, domesticity, conceived of as endogamous, serves as the foundation for national health and longevity. Domesticity is also related to slavery. Nineteenth-century proslavery apologists, like George Fitzhugh, used domestic affection as a foil to claim that slave owners' sense of familial and domestic obligation would ensure that slaves were treated with the same kindness as white family members. ShelleyIntroduction employs a similar logic when she makes us sympathetic to the creation's claim that he committed evil acts because Frankenstein had failed to fulfill his familial duty. To read a genealogy of colonial domesticity in Frankenstein is to read the text as a site where colonial history converged with the history of domesticity. Colonial adulteration was felt in signs of adulteration at home; the text, like the monster, is adulterated. Frankenstein is an apocalyptic vision of a world unavoidably menaced by cultural adulteration, where the domestic home is disallowed and the domestic nation is threatened by the possibility of a hybrid species of monster- men. The domestic instability Shelley articulates is paralleled by the multiple voices that narrate the story, and that, like the Monster's mottled body, reveal the seams in the narrative. The difficulty of generic categorization and the text's narrative layering mimic the text's refusal to domesticate the monster. This book is not an exhaustive study of eighteenth- century British literature. Rather, I offer a series of close readings intended to untangle the intertextured discourses of colonialism and domesticity. Just as travelers voyaged through sea swells in their colonial travels, British writers engaged in literary acrobatics to account for the Englishneess of the British colonial enterprise. In the ambiguous stories England told itself about cultural purity and national identity, writers swerved between lauding domestic virtue and blasting domestic dissipation. But English libertines, Creole profligates, virtuous English wives, and lascivious Creole mistresses did not gel as stock literary characters until late in the eighteenth century, when categories of racial difference took on a new fixity. Throughout the century, tropes of colonial difference permeated and refashioned domestic discourse in ways that changed the face of English narrative. In attending to these changes, I hope to refocus our conversation on British literature by suggesting a new way of reading that helps us refigure domesticity, but one that alsoAdventures in Domesticity helps us to understand the operations of nationalism and ethnic difference in the transatlantic eighteenth century. Notes Janet Todd notes that West's adoption of the pseudonym Prudentia Homespun (which would imply that she is a spinster) and the preference for poor or bourgeois women over aristocratic women expressed in her fiction was consistent with the “conservative backlash” of the late eighteenth century (Feminist Literary History [New York: Routledge, 1988], 209). Todd writes: “Simple irritation was provoked by the aristocratic woman who appeared to be escaping the bourgeois morality of female chastity, 'the prostitute of high life' as Jane West contemptuously called her” (209). - As in Sussana Rowson's contemporary American novella, Charlotte Temple, the French boarding school mistress is of low character. A typical figure, she often catalyzed the downfall of the virtuous heroine by enabling the rake to have access to the heroine's virtue. Such figures of French menace to English virtue shuttle back and forth across the Atlantic in the literature of the 1990s, and are testament to the association of revolutionary fear with female virtue, a treasure that became the more highly guarded during times of social instability. It is also evident that domestic virtue was politically important on numerous levels. See, for example, Linda Colley, Britons: Forging the Nation (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992), chapter 6, “Womanpower,” subheading "War and the Sexes,” where she discusses the accusations of sexual immorality leveled against Frenchwomen who were said to have “too much of the wrong kind of power,” a (typical) collision of sexual and political power (250-62). 3. On the representation of Creole figures in English literature, see Wylie Sypher's Guinea's Captive Kings: BritishIntroduction Anti-Slavery Literature of the XVIIIth Century (New York: Octagon Books, 1969). * In Living by the Pen: Early British Women Writers (New York: Teachers' College Press, 1992), Dale Spender notes that West prefaces the story with a wish to “enstruct rather than to entertain” her readers (205). The moral authority of Mrs. Williams and Jane West unite “through a conceptual link between writer and mother” (202). On the authority of the female didactic novelist, Spender writes: “the `authority of preceptress and the mistress of a family' became the model for the woman writer's authority and the basis for her claim to ‘respect and attention from the reading public" (202). Janet Todd locates Mrs. Williams's maternal authority within the context of a Wollstonecraftian feminism of the late eighteenth century: "the moral reactional novel preached domesticity and resignation.” Of West in particular, Todd says: all her novels ... attacked the new philosophy of liberation and took badly brought-up girls to ruin, often through a feminist desire for adultery or simply some initiating activity, seen as defiance of omnipotence since the divine scheme dictated subordination and passivity for women. The new philosophy was invariably tried out through male sexual seduction, and invariably found ruinous to domestic (and national) peace and moderate happiness. The particular feminine trajectory stood in for the trajectory of the nation. (1989: 233) In Defoe's Roxana, the Fortunate Mistress (ed. David Blewett New York: Penguin, 1987]), Roxana refuses a marriage offer from a wealthy man she loves because marriage laws deprived women of basic rights, reducing them to a stateAdventures in Domesticity of servitude. She says: “a Woman gave herself entirely away from herself, in Marriage, and capitulated only to be, at best, but an Upper-Servant" (187). Roxana also repeatedly equated marriage with slavery. See Felicity Nussbaum, Torrid Zones: Maternity, Sexuality, and Empire in Eighteenth-Century English Narratives (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1995). She argues that colonial projects capitalized on the sexual and reproductive forces of women and says that the construction of the virtuous English lady depended upon the figure of the promiscuous, "exotic" other woman of empire. Nussbaum reads out these relations in eighteenth-century British narrative. ? Nancy Armstrong has claimed that “the rise of the novel was related to the emergence of women's writing” ("Some Call It Fiction: On the Politics of Domesticity,” in Feminisms: An Anthology of Literary Theory and Criticism, ed.

AmandaIntroduction Vickery's “Golden Age to Separate Spheres? A Review of the Categories and Chronology of English Women's History,” The Historical Journal 36. 2 (1993): 383-414, is a valuable historiographical review. 9 See, for instance, Gayatri Spivak's essay, “Three Women's Texts and a Critique of Imperialism,” in Feminisms, ed. Warhol and Price Herndl. A central claim of hers is that "It should not be possible to read nineteenth-century British literature without remembering that imperialism, understood as England's social mission, was a crucial part of the cultural representation of England to the English” (896). See also Firdous Azim, whose book, The Colonial Rise of the Novel (New York: Routledge, 1993), is predicated on the claim that "the novel is an imperial genre” (30). See also Gayatri Spivak, A Critique of Postcolonial Reason: Toward a History of the Vanishing Present (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1999); Anne McClintock, Imperial Leather: Race, Gender and Sexuality in the Colonial Context (New York: Routledge, 1995); Robert Young, Colonial Desire: Hybridity in Theory, Culture and Race (New York: Routledge, 1995). This is only a small sampling. 10 Edward Said's Orientalism (New York: Pantheon Books, 1978) and Culture and Imperialism (New York: Random House, 1994) refocused literary criticism by claiming, for one, that “without empire ... there is no European novel as we know it” (Culture 69). Recent postcolonial and feminist critics have taken him to task for failing to adequately consider the roles of sexuality and gender within colonialism. 11 Two recent, contrasting takes on British national identity are Colley's Britons and Srinivas Aravamudan's Tropicopolitans: Colonialism and Agency, 1688-1804 (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1999). AravamudanAdventures in Domesticity contests Colley's narrative, claiming that her focus on Protestantism is too narrow. 12 Most notable are Laura Brown, Ends of Empire: Women and Ideology in Early Eighteenth-Century English Literature (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1993) and Nussbaum, Torrid Zones. As the titles indicate, their works focus on representations of women and sexuality in the context of mercantile capitalism and the construction of female, colonial difference. Domesticity figures into their critiques but is not the primary subject of study. The polymorphous forms and cacophonous voices that peopled domestic narratives suggest a Bakhtinian instability of language that parallels the shifting and unstable way Britain represented itself in writing. Bahktin's argument that the novel is "heteroglot, multi-voiced, and often multi-languaged” because it is peopled by a “diversity of social speech types ... and a diversity of individual voices" — in short, that the novel is not monological, is a useful analytic optic through which to rethink traditional Enlightenment readings of eighteenth- century British literature, especially in relation to colonial discourse. Such a view allows us to challenge patriarchal narratives that typically excluded the categories of gender and race from literary criticism. See Mikhail Bahktin's chapter, “Discourse in the Novel," in The Dialogic Imagination, ed. Michael Holquist, trans. Caryl Emerson and Michael Holquist (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1981). 14 The following books, all of which stress so-called mainstream canon formation, deal exclusively with male travelers. They mention women travelers only in passing, thus effectively propounding the idea that travel and adventure were the exclusive realm of men: Percy Adams's Travel Literature and the Evolution of the Novel (New York: Dover, 1962), andIntroduction 25 Travelers and Travel Liars, 1660-1800 (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1983); Charles Lynn Batten's Pleasurable Instruction: Form and Convention in Eighteenth-Century Travel Literature (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1978); The Art of Travel: Essays on Travel Writing (Totowa, NJ: Frank Cass and Co., 1982), edited by Phillip Dodd, who, in his preface, regrets “the absence of women travelers. A contributor who had offered an essay had to withdraw at the last moment and there was insufficient time to commission a replacement”; Casey Blanton's Travel Writing: The Self and the World (New York: Twayne, 1997) has a chapter on Mary Kingsley; Philip Edwards's The Story of the Voyage: Sea- Narratives in Eighteenth-Century England (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1994) includes some women in the chapter on passengers; William Stowe's Going Abroad: European Travel in Nineteenth-Century American Culture (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994) has a chapter on Margaret Fuller; Neil Rennie's Far-Fetched Facts: The Literature of Travel and the Idea of the South Seas (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995) mentions nearly no women writers. Recent studies of women's travel writing typically signal their gendered approach in the title: Catherine Stevenson's Victorian Women Travel Writers in Africa (Boston: Twayne, 1982); Sara Mill's Discourses of Difference: An Analysis of Women's Travel Writing and Colonialism (New York: Routledge, 1991); Alison Blunt's Travel, Gender, and Imperialism: Mary Kingsley and West Africa (New York: Guildford, 1994); Elizabeth Bohls' Women Travel Writers and the Language of Aesthetics, 1716-1818 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1995); Suzanne Stark's Female Tars: Women Aboard Ship in the Age of Sail (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1996); Indira Ghose's Women Travellers in Colonial India: The Power of the Female Gaze (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998); Women Through Women's Eyes:Adventures in Domesticity Latin American Women in Nineteenth-Century Travel Accounts (Wilmington, DE: Scholarly Resources, 1998), edited by June Hahner; Joan Druett's Hen Frigates: Wives of Merchant Captains Under Sail (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1998); Marilyn Wesley's Secret Journeys: The Trope of Women's Travel in American Literature (Albany: SUNY Press, 1999). Although few critics have addressed travel writing by both men and women, there are some excellent exceptions, such as Mary Louise Pratt's Imperial Eyes (New York: Routledge, 1992) and Nussbaum's Torrid Zones. 15 Nussbaum, Torrid Zones, also connects colonial sexuality with the development of a national consciousness. She writes: “England's national imperative to control women's sexuality and fertility in the eighteenth century is connected to the formation of a national identity” and to empire (96). And she and Brown (Ends of Empire) have argued that English virtuous womanhood depended upon the image of an exotic sexualized other, a dynamic visible in many genres of writing. 16 See Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre (New York: Norton, 2001) and Jean Rhys's postcolonial novel, Wide Sargasso Sea (New York: Norton, 1998), which rewrites the novel from the point of view of Rochester and Antoinette/ Bertha, the woman whom Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar famously named "the madwoman in the attic.” The most well-known postcolonial analysis of this pair of novels is Spivak's “Three Women's Texts and a Critique of Imperialism,” in Feminisms, ed. Warhol and Price Herndl.Chapter 1 “Homely Adventures": Domesticity, Adulteration, and Cultural Mixing in Daniel Defoe's Captain Singleton In the middle of Daniel Defoe's 1720 novel Captain Singleton, the eponymous hero roves the oceans in search of piratical booty. Carefully crafting his account of illegitimate trade, Singleton narrates the following scene of illicit sexual commerce. His ship has docked at Ceylon, an island in the Indian Ocean (now Sri Lanka), in search of water and provisions. Though the land is “inhabited for the greatest Part by Barbarians,” it is Singleton and his eleven man crew who must "pay dear” for “some barbarous thing they had done” to the local women: We had a little Skirmish on Shore here with some of the People of the Island, some of our Men having been a little too familiar with the Homely Ladies of the country; for Homely indeed they were, to such a Degree, that if our Men had not had good Stomachs that Way, they would scarce have touch'd any of them." Singleton's phrase "homely ladies” assumes several shades of meaning. Homely is, of course, an adjective meaning ugly, but it also carries the adverbial meaning intimately, which puts28 Adventures in Domesticity another kind of ugly spin on their skirmish, for Singleton intimates that the intimacy is rape. Further, a "homely- woman” signifies “a domestic” (OED), again a term that bears out several meanings. The women are “domestic” in that they sexually serv(ic)e the pirates, a meaning that anticipates the domesticating forces of plantation slavery, which relied upon the sexual labor of women to generate a physical labor force. At the same time, these women are not “domestic" Englishwomen. Indeed, the pirates' sexual commerce violates the premise upon which the "cult of domesticity” was predicated: female virtue. Such was their piratical intention: away from ladies at home (England), they wage their intimacies on the homely women of Ceylon. Singleton puts a further spin on this semantic promiscuity. Although homely also means “without reserve or circumlocution; plainly” (OED), Singleton remains vague in his description of the incident: “I could never fully get it out of our Men what they did, they were so true to one another in their Wickedness” (218). Thus the pirates' lack of reserve with women translates into narrative reserve: we are not given the full story. Singleton's semantic play and his vacillation between disclosure and secrecy could also be viewed as descriptive of Defoe's narrative method in Captain Singleton. In the above scene, as in others we shall survey, Defoe partly masks his narrative (strategically telling a story by recounting its omissions) as a way to remind his reader that words and narratives require clarification. In particular, the term home emerges in multiple forms that, taken together, call into question the ambiguous assumptions that underwrite both metropolitan and colonial domesticity. As the quotation that begins this chapter suggests, Defoe's work grapples with questions of commercial and sexual economy in early-eighteenth-century transatlantic England. Addressing the interplay between definitions of domestic as home and as nation, Defoe's work both anticipates“Homely Adventures" 29 and sets the stage for struggles with domestic concerns. As recent critics have contended, Captain Singleton responds to economic and social changes following the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, which facilitated imperial expansion, mercantile capitalism, and demographic shifts from rural to urban centers. Increased international commerce (both social and economic) called into question the definition of home and England's “domestic” identity. Anxieties about these socioeconomic changes were visible in fictive accounts of adventurous travel, which proliferated during the first quarter of the century. As I will demonstrate, in Captain Singleton, Defoe manipulates the meaning of home in order to navigate social changes wrought by colonialism and cultural mixing. As I have already suggested, and as we shall see with more detail later, the eighteenth century discursive usage of home was not limited to the domestic realm, but extended its semantic alliance to trade and political economy. The contemporary usage of the term adventure forged similar alliances. As is well-known, adventure was used to signify a capitalist venture as often as a romantic escapade. And, as we know, Defoe uses the word to preface the lives of Robinson Crusoe and Captain Singleton.“ Frequently, sexual escapades were interlaced through travel adventures, blurring any clear distinction between the two uses of the word. As Martin Green put it, “in general, adventure seems to mean a series of events, partly but not wholly accidental, in settings remote from the domestic and probably from the civilized” (23). Adventure's signification of a capitalist venture or a sexual encounter both seem antithetical to a notion of domestic home. This seeming incongruity between home and adventure has led to a pervasive critical fallacy that has regarded adventure as a male endeavor of the public realm and home as the domestic space proper to the static private woman. Defoe scholarship has read Defoe's fiction as adventure tales (either through the seamy life of London or through the exotic30 Adventures in Domesticity landscapes of the Occident or the torrid zones), and as colonial propaganda.' While it is a critical commonplace to claim that the eighteenth-century novel must be understood in relation to travel narratives, most criticism of the novel and travel literature has focused on travel as male adventure unrelated to gender, sex, or colonialism. But sexuality and domesticity were the very political and commercial business of fiction, inaugurated by travel literature, as in the novels of Daniel Defoe. The phrase "homely adventures” signals a collapse of traditional gender binaries, such as public/private, man/woman, home/away, and that is one of my aims: to question the “ideology of separate spheres” that argues that the female domestic home and male public spaces were mutually exclusive domains, and which, based mostly nineteenth- century literature, caught the eighteenth century in its teleological tailspin. Growing out of American and British feminist scholarship that aimed to recuperate female agency and subjectivity in literature, "separate spheres” resulted in an enormous and valuable amount of criticism that sometimes unwittingly perpetuated the same social divisions it was attempting to dismantle. I want to refute the notion that the eighteenth century inexorably moved toward a public/private split in the Victorian era. Rather, gender roles in the eighteenth century were shifting and often confused and were certainly not bound to a rigid division between home life and public life. Situating homely concerns in the public sphere rewrites the master narrative propounded by most feminist criticism of the novel. In the early eighteenth century, so-called public and private spaces had shifting boundaries. True, in many fictional accounts of the adventures of commercial travel, the domestic home was posited as ballast for the social changes wrought by personal, national, and international travel. But home was also often built upon the ugly affairs of the characters' sexual or economic commerce. Roxana's home was purchased at the“Homely Adventures” 31 price of her daughter's life; Moll's through incest and crime; Singleton's with the blood of his colonial trading "partners”; and both Robinson Crusoe and Captain Singleton describe how the homes of colonized places were peopled with the unwilling "wives” of settlers. Thus Defoe's manipulation of the domestic trope and the meaning of home provides us with insight into the way England's domestic identity changed as a result of international cultural mixing. I will argue in later chapters that English fears about such cultural mixing “infected” late-eighteenth-century discourse. But in early- eighteenth-century fiction, cultural difference is not so much a source of anxiety as it is a means of mobility and financial gain. In this chapter, I argue that Defoe's Captain Singleton articulates emerging concerns about England's domestic identity as a developing commercial nation. Further, just as Defoe capitalized on adulterated narratives (novels that masqueraded as travel narratives), Defoe's characters use liminal spaces of cultural crossing to their benefit and participate in what I will call colonial masquerade. Homely Adventures I warrant you, says I, you begin to hanker after Home. -Daniel Defoe, Captain Singleton After years of piratical adventures from which Daniel Defoe's antihero, Captain Singleton, has generated enormous wealth, he is prompted by his companion in skullduggery, Quaker William, to consider retiring from the pirate trade. William asks Singleton “if thou hast gotten enough, [if] thou hast any Thought of leaving off this Trade” (256), insisting that home must be their "natural" direction after years of itinerant commerce, "for no body trades for the sake of Trading, much less do any Men rob for the sake of Thieving" (256). Theft and commerce, so casually bound together here, must have anAdventures in Domesticity idea to underwrite them, and William proffers home as the unquestioned subtext of their piracy: “it is natural for most Men that are abroad to desire to come Home again at last, especially when they are grown rich” (256). The home William envisions is a sentimental one, not just a location, but an idea around which are constellated “Relations or Friends," “Kindness [...and] Respect” (257). But Singleton resists the predictable ending of conversion and rural retirement, preferring to domesticate unfamiliarity and to defamiliarize the domestic. For he is so at home with foreign adventures, that he embraces his pirate ship as home: but you have not explained what you mean by Home, and there you and I shall differ. Why, Man, I am at Home, here is my Habitation, I never had any other in my Life time; I was a kind of Charity School-Boy, so that I can have no Desire of going any where for being rich or poor, for I have no where to go. (256) Singleton's rejection of the English home is a refusal of the domestic on two levels: the domestic home and the domestic nation. He disavows England, professing more “Kindness...for the Island of Madagascar" (257) than his place of birth; his insistent refusal to accept William's naturalization of the idea of home is also a refusal of national identity. But his declaration — “I am at Home" — seems implicitly at odds with his location: their pirate ship, a place usually conceived of as devoid of warmth as the pirate flag's skull and crossbones. The “roving, cruising Life," with its requisite foreign ventures, colonial encounters, and commercial and sexual exploits, may meet the demands of an adventure narrative, but it seems inherently antithetical to the idea of home (257). It is something of a surprise, then, when Singleton eventually trades his pirate-ship home for one in England,“Homely Adventures” 33 perhaps not for the sentimental reasons suggested by William, but to secure a place to deposit his wealth. When the two men finally do travel to England, William's sister, a widow with four children, enables their incognito return, for her rural domesticity is the ideal filter for their illicit wealth. But if marriage and domesticity are held out as promise of the narrative's resolution, contracted to recast the pirate adventurer Captain Bob (as Singleton was called) as rural domestic husband, Defoe refutes the fiction of the stable English home by showing that it is born out of illegitimate means and is occupied by masqueraders. Home, as William conceives it, underwrites piracy, and it is also the subtext for Defoe's narration. Each time Singleton uses the term home — to describe an adventure, to talk about England, to describe non-English women – he disallows clarity, often using one definition to cast its shadow of meaning over another definition. The novel's putative closure and its semantic opacity raise the broader question so important to early eighteenth-century England: what is the relation between the wealth of foreign adventure(r)s and the English home? Defoe upsets the possibility of a stable home from the outset of Singleton's story. Singleton's narrative is framed by illegitimacy, from the “Gypsy Mother" (2) who stole his legitimate lineage to the mock domestic closure of his marriage with Quaker William's sister, through whom his enormous illicit wealth is converted into British stock and the promise of virtuous English heirs. Kidnapped and orphaned by the age of twelve, Bob Singleton's narrative quickly fits into a familiar early-eighteenth-century life story: he goes to sea. Set upon by an “Algerine rover” (3), Singleton is taken captive and sails on a Portuguese ship to the East Indies. Escaping the rope, he is abandoned with a crew of fellow unsuccessful mutineers on the shores of Madagascar, whence his peregrinations begin.34 Adventures in Domesticity Singleton and twenty-seven other men vow to “live and die together” (20) as they make their way to the African continent and begin their journey toward the West Coast. After a year of traveling, they meet up with a “stark naked” Englishman who had been stranded by trade skirmishes (120). In exchange for his deliverance — "we clothed him, shaved him, ... cut his hair,” and told him “his Fate (was) with us” — their new guide and interpreter directs them to a place where the river runs gold (123, 126). Visually, the stranded trader is a wild man, though his manner reveals him to be a gentleman. His unhappy Circumstance” (121) cautions that the instability of the trade can brutalize a “mannerly well-bred Person,” (122) stripping him not just of clothing but also of other visual markers of civilization: “his Beard was grown exceeding long, and the Hair of his Head and face strangely covered him to the Middle of his Back and Breast, he was white, and his Skin very fine, tho' discoloured, and in some Places blistered and covered with a brown blackish Substance, scurfy, scaly” (121). Here is the literary ancestor of Joseph Conrad's Kurtz in Heart of Darkness: the Englishman who has "gone native" in the wilds of Africa. By the nineteenth century he is a recognizable trope for civilization's regressions or ancestry. In the eighteenth century, travel accounts are just beginning to be peopled with Englishmen altered in appearance and address by their contact with Africa or the tropics. I argue in the second half of this chapter that such figures often serve to mediate between indigenous cultures and Western men. In eighteenth-century travel literature, many characters like Singleton carried on social and economic commerce with so-called uncivilized nations. Toward the end of the century, when miscegenation (often in the form of rape) became more publicly discussed, fiction transformed the dangers of the putatively lascivious African into the ambiguously gendered white Creole, homing in on the domestic threat of miscegenation and cultural creolization. Such Creole figures“Homely Adventures" also took the place of hybrid figures, who eventually transformed into the Englishman gone native, typified by Conrad's Kurtz. A figure like Aphra Behn's Oroonoko is such an in-between figure, since his aristocratic lineage in some respects mitigates his African heritage. Recall, too, Robert Drury, an autobiographical writer believed by some to be the fictional invention of Defoe. He is rescued from enslavement in Madagascar and returns years later as a slave trader, valued for his fluency in Malagasy and his ability to negotiate between local rulers and European traders. He, too, was described as appearing more Malagasy native than white when Captain Mackett found him. In Captain Singleton, this new guide (who, remarkably, is never named) stands between civilization and savagery, and negotiates the homely adventures for Singleton's men. For Defoe, colonial difference is determined not only by cultural markers, but is also judged by economic measures. The following scene takes place during an extensive gold dig, and the parataxis is revelatory of the sexual and commercial ideology upon which the novel is structured. About halfway through his journal, Singleton mentions sex for the first time. Somewhere near the Niger river in West Africa, he and his men suspend their travels to set up camp for a gold dig. Singleton says: we had many pleasant Adventures with the Savages, too long to mention here, and some of them too homely to tell of; for some of our Men had made something free with their Women, which, had not our new Guide made Peace for us with one of their Men, at the Price of seven fine Bits of Silver, which our Artificer had cut out into the Shapes of Lions, and Fishes, and Birds, and had punch'd Holes to hang them up by (an inestimable Treasure!) we must haveAdventures in Domesticity gone to War with them and all their People. (130) The rare moments of sexual commerce in Captain Singleton are narratively embedded in scenes of trade and are recounted in the language of business. But sex – to use Defoe's language — was “no booty to them"; their business was gold (115). Singleton's phrasing in the later passage suggests that “homely” adventures are equivalent to sexual commerce, a form of trade that threatens to divert the men from lucre. Indeed, the climactic moment in the description establishes the orientation of Singleton's commercial travel: he ejaculates "an inestimable treasure!” in praise of the artificer's ability to work metal for the purpose of trade. But, whereas the metal shapes had previously been exchanged for provisions, here they are compensation for sexual liberties. The unauthorized sexual encounter prefigures later sexual piracy, which will be similarly resolved through business transaction. Thus the reader, momentarily tantalized by sexual intrigue, is directed back to the business of trade. This transaction is also a means for Defoe to achieve narrative fulfillment by deflecting rape onto riverbed rapine. Indeed, the spoils are so compelling that, although they “were all more desirous to get Home than to be rich,” they continue to “Fish for Gold” for nearly a year before concluding their journey (131-32). Here, home signifies a vague notion of Europe, a rescue from Africa, but also implies that even in the midst of a “vast howling Wilderness," sexual familiarity can flavor adventures as “homely" (112). Sex is described almost exclusively as rape. As we saw in the passage that opened this chapter, Singleton's men are “a little too familiar with the Homely Ladies of the country,” a freedom Singleton calls “a barbarous thing” and a “Wickedness” (218). Another time, we hear that “a White Man abused the Negroe Man's Wife, and afterwards his“Homely Adventures” Daughter” (161), just as, in the above instance, their “pleasant Adventures” include “makſing] something free with their Women" (130). In all cases, the transgressions are negotiated with money or battle, and it is clear that sex is subject to the laws of trade and women are subjects of the laws of trade. Like other contemporary writing, Defoe's novels register the importance of sexuality to commerce." As Firdous Azim argues, “in Defoe's texts sex was presented as adventure, comparable to colonial adventures, and promiscuous sexual behavior was used by the female protagonists for their rise in the emerging capitalist world” (185). Defoe's female protagonists navigate the sexual labyrinths of their culture in order to arrive at financial stability. His male protagonists also manipulate sexual codes in order to arrive at financial stability, which results in a kind of sexual geography of England's economic landscape. Unsurprisingly, then, the first allusion to sexuality in Captain Singleton is circumscribed by multiple lists of animal shapes wrought by the cutler. The lists displace the vivid detail and awe of the live animals Singleton encounters in Africa with a discussion of the economics of colonial trade. The cataloguing of hand-shaped animals symbolically reworks and manages the potential menace Singleton's travelers face on their journey. Along with the harvesting of animal parts (elephant's teeth, lion and leopard skins), these European fashioned representations are proxy animals more highly valued than the flesh and bone they signify Singleton repeatedly tells his reader that the small bits shaped by his cutler can be exchanged for far more valuable items, such as gold, skins, or provisions, revealing a strange, circular trade in raw goods and their representation. Moreover, Singleton's calculations are measured according to European trade standards; hence the signs of European traders carry more weight than the actual weight of gold. Novak historicizes this kind of trade, asserting that the38 Adventures in Domesticity themes of "piracy, the value of money, exploitation — are all reflections on what was happening in Britain during the furor over the collapse of the South Sea Company's manipulation of stock.” He concludes that “the paradox of business as crime and crime as a business was a driving force behind almost all of [Defoe's] fiction” (“Defoe as Innovator” 53). But Brown has remarked that, in Captain Singleton, “trade defines civilization; and that an understanding of exchange value is inherently superior to a dependence on use value. Civilization and racial superiority are thus associated with exchange value.”2 And Aparna Dharwadkan has made a convincing argument for the central role of a racialist discourse in the formation of Defoe's mercantilist ideology. He bases his argument on a reading of Robinson Crusoe and on a passage from Defoe's Review: The most telling sign of the Africans' primitivism is that their currency consists of “Insignificant and Unvaluable Trifles,” when most other nations (including non-European nations like China, Japan, and Mongolia) have adopted gold and silver as the basis of exchange. Hence for Defoe Africa is a place where “it has been worth no Bodies while to make them wise," and the ignorant Africans who trade gold for trifles are “a poor heap of Useless Creatures, fit to be Bubbl’d, and made Slaves to the rest of the World.":13 Singleton's narrative reflects the organizational principles of England's emerging identity as an international trading nation whose economy is based upon (sexual and) cultural difference. It is unsurprising that cultural difference and international trade would appear in an adventure novel since travel was the central material condition of the eighteenth"Homely Adventures" century. If travel was the lifeblood of the English social body, then trade formed its backbone. According to Linda Colley, the “cult of commerce" underwrote England's identity, leaving abundant literary testimony to the powerful ethos of trade. Colley asserts that this “cult of commerce" resulted from a substantial involvement in trade: “Perhaps one in every five families in eighteenth-century Britain drew its livelihood from trade and distribution" (56) so that "until the end of the ... century, customs and excise levies together supplied over 60 per cent of government revenue, and sometimes more than 70 per cent” (65). Eighteenth-century historian Bryan Edwards credits colonial commerce with strengthening the military and keeping the nation united: To what extent the naval power of Great Britain is dependant on her colonial commerce, it is difficult to ascertain. If this trade be considered in all its channels, collateral and direct, connected as it is with our fisheries, &c. perhaps it is not too much to affirm, that it maintains a merchant navy on which the maritime strength of the kingdom so greatly depends, that we should cease to be a nation without it. (Book 4, chapter 3, 375) Colley argues that the ethos of trade was visible not just in social history, but in many forms of writing: "the claim that trade was the muscle and the soul of Great Britain, both the source of its greatness and the nursery of patriots, was abundantly echoed in the poetry, drama, novels, newspapers, tracts, parliamentary speeches, private correspondence, even the sermons of the time" (59). Traditionally, the great demographic, social, and political changes in the eighteenth century have been attributed to urbanization, Protestantism, individualism, and an exponential surge in both domestic andAdventures in Domesticity global commerce. These changes were facilitated by improved and expanded travel and trade routes." The English public became familiar, through fiction and other popular print forms, such as newspapers and travel narratives, with the great demographic, social, and political changes brought about by urbanization and an exponential surge in both domestic and global commerce. Singleton is a fictional representation of the many Englishmen who tried to make their fortune through trade in African products, and his narration suggests that the economy Defoe so valued for its role in developing national strength was one based upon colonial difference. Just as Singleton's troop can trade their articulated signs of African animals for gold, Singleton carefully crafts his articulation of illegitimate trade for narrative gain. The next homely adventure takes place years later, while Singleton is at the height of his profession as a pirate. Here, illicit commerce between the sexes is less easily compensated than in Africa. The passage that opened this chapter, where Singleton's men "were a little too familiar with the Homely ladies” of Ceylon is the most extensive passage about rape (218). But the descriptions that merit detail in Singleton's textual relation are those of battle and exchanges, and Singleton focuses mainly on the physical relations between men. He tells his reader that “the Dutch were Lords of the Country as to Commerce ... and in particular, have all the Cinnamon, which is the Trade on that Island” (218), though later he says that Ceylon “will not allow any Trade or Commerce with any European Nation” (238). But Singleton's description reveals that the interaction between his pirates and the people of the island is indeed one of commerce. The pirates' illicit sexual commerce instigates a different kind of exchange: the trade in blows. “In the first Skirmish they killed between sixty and seventy Men and wounded a great many more, but they had nothing, and our People got nothing by it, but the Loss of one Man's Life and the Wounding sixteen more” (220). Singleton's men are nearly“Homely Adventures” 41 overwhelmed by the islander's puissance: “had not sixteen more of our Men, in another Boat, come all in the Nick of Time, just to rescue our first Men, who were but Eleven ... they had been all overwhelmed and kill'd” (218-19). Even though the pirates were guilty of sexual freebooting, it is they who are said to be “warm upon their Revenge," and who “shall have (their) Satisfaction," rather than the “Men (who] had a Right to their own" (219). Female sexuality has the power to convert barbarians into men under Nature's laws, but it is, like the earlier homely adventure, a trade between men, guided either by “the Laws of Nature," as William argues in the islanders' defense, or the laws of trade, and redacted in the language of business. So, when “sixty or seventy [more] Men” join forces with the pirates, William reminds them that sexual commerce and the trade in warfare could only detract from their account: “if I mistake not, your Business is Money” (219). But Singleton's narrative suggests that a financial account is comprised of more than a simple amassing of wealth. His account (his journal, his narrative), indeed Defoe's novel, becomes a series of colonial exchanges whose value it is Singleton's job to articulate into narrative. Narrative capital is increased by stories of both women and booty, which are conflated at several points during the novel. The “flaming stories of Captain Avery include "a great Prize in the Bay of Bengal, where he took a Lady said to be the Great Mogul's Daughter, with a great Quantity of Jewels about her.” Next, we hear that "he took a Mogul Ship,... loaden with Diamonds” (154). The lady and the ship share the same verb of conquest: both are taken, and both are vehicles for jewels. Singleton repeats the story a little further on: “Captain Avery . . . took several rich Prizes, and amongst the rest, one Ship with the Great Mogul's Daughter, and an immense Treasure in Money and Jewels” (179), and again, it is unclear whether or not the woman is included in the account of spoils. Lucre is feminized just as women are commercialized; both are42 Adventures in Domesticity bounty to be taken “by fair means or foul” (78)." Captain Avery and Captain Wilmot are able to stay on Madagascar because the captured women they have transported there will enable them to establish a colony: “it seems five Dutch Women, and three or four little Girls were taken by them in a Dutch Ship which they afterwards took going to Mocha, and three of those Women marrying some of these Men, went with them to live in their new Plantation” (183). Here is the language of plunder — again, the women are taken with the ship — but it is also the language of colonial commerce. The women required for their "plantation” are evocative of female slaves used as breeders to produce laboring offspring. Nation building, female sexual capital, and home all intersect in the domestic trope. And Singleton's piratical and narrative capital both benefit from such crossings. Colonial projects in Defoe's novels (and the novels themselves) structurally rely upon a domestic economy that was itself based upon sexual(ized) capital. Recent scholarship has demonstrated that early-eighteenth-century fiction often registers anxiety about female virtue as concern over the products of colonial commerce. Laura Brown argues that “sexuality is ... another persistent problem connected with the feminization of mercantile capitalist ideology" (5). And Felicity Nussbaum maps out the sexual geography of empire, showing that the relation between English women and “other” women of empire reveals that a "national imperative to control women's sexuality and fecundity emerged when the increasing demands of trade and colonization required a large, able- bodied citizenry, and that women's reproductive labor was harnessed to that task” (1). In Captain Singleton and Robinson Crusoe, new colonies are populated by (often kidnapped) women, and the life patterns of Moll Flanders and Roxana are determined by sexual geography. Moreover, commercial practices and encounters with natives are often sexualized in his novels. Moments of sexual conquest are often embedded in“Homely Adventures" scenes of commercial exchange. Even narration itself is erotically charged. Just as Singleton's pirates are “ripe for villainy,” Defoe makes bold with narrative: he uses language to entice, obscure, or conceal. By displacing the specifically sexualized threat of illegitimate travel and its close relative, colonial commerce, onto language, Defoe subverts any claims to safety by the very telling of his tale. In the following scenes, home is not explicitly used as it is in earlier passages. But Defoe's emphasis on the rarity and authenticity of his narrative, a narrative about the commercial and martial penetration of uncharted (virgin) territory,' makes his narration of this scene important to our understanding of home and domestic for several reasons. First, Singleton's declared (and Defoe's implicit) concern with the commercial value of his narrative speaks to the rapidly expanding domestic demand for orientalist stories." Second, the importance of colonial difference to the interaction between pirates and wild others, and to the narration of his story, reveals the emerging importance of colonial difference to England's identity as a developing commercial nation. Ostensibly commercial gain drives the narrative. Among other things, homely adventures caution that sexual drives threaten to distract men from their commercial purposes, and divert the direction of their travels even when they are desultory, as in the second half of the novel. In the following scene, Defoe inflects his narration with the kind of promiscuity that characterized piratical plundering. In search of provisions Singleton's ship lands on an island somewhere in the Indian Ocean. They quickly find the “Indians” unwelcoming. But, though they “shot our Flag of Truce thro' several times with their Arrows" (205) and affected a “threatening Posture,” the Indians bear a certain resemblance to Singleton's European crew. They are “clothed and arm’d, but their Clothes were only about their lower and middle Parts” (206). They are not- quite-repetitions who stand somewhere between the nakedAdventures in Domesticity savages of the African continent and the clothed civilians of Europe." They wore “great high Things on their Heads, made, as we believed, of Feathers, and which look'd something like our Grenadiers Caps in England” (206). This visual hybrid, where cultural others wear the outer markings of Englishmen, glances back to the European pirates, pointing to the ambivalence of identity that will (illegibly) articulate itself through language." The hybrid figure also has affinities with the in-between figure of the naked Englishmen Singleton finds in Africa. Angered by being shot at, Singleton watches his pirate crew retaliate: “our men went like a little Army, and with mighty Preparations for an Enterprize, the like of which has scarce been ever heard to form the Siege of a great Tree" (208). Singleton remains at some narrative distance here, captain of the crew, and observer of the action. As we shall see, the battle ends with no material gain to the pirates, and the value of the “enterprize” becomes the story. According to Singleton, the scarcity of the narrative — “the like of which has scarce been ever heard” (208) — is what gives this episode currency. Singleton's appreciation of narrative capital extends back to the beginning of his travels; he makes a similar remark about the English guide who led him across Africa. Singleton calls the stranded English trader's story "an Adventure that never was heard or read of before" (121). He views narrative as a daring and bold adventure, a textual enterprise that, like piracy, yields satisfaction. While the Indians visually mimic the Europeans in dress, Defoe naturalizes them, utterly conflating people with landscape: he describes a "prodigious great Trunk of an old Tree” and men who “shot at (us) from the Top of the Tree, with seven Arrows, and three Launces” (207). Singleton finally locates his enemy: “besides the howling Noise they made in the Tree, our Men heard a strange Clutter of them in the Body of the Tree” (208). And later, Singleton and William"Homely Adventures” 45 discover the reason for their failed assault on the tree: “there was a Cave or Hole dug into the Earth, from, or thro’ the Bottom of the Hollow, and that it had Communication with another Cave further in, where we heard the Voices of several of the wild Folks calling and talking to one another” (212). Again, voices are metonymy for people; they float in and through the mazes of landscape, inaccessible to the hostile pirates. Defoe's landscaping the native is the kind of literary gesture that was visible in travel narratives. For example, William Snelgrave's 1734 A New Account of Some Parts of Guinea and the Slave Trade describes a “Land ... so stock'd with People, that the whole Country appeared full of Towns and Villages; And being a very rich Soil, and well cultivated by the Inhabitants, it looked like an intire Garden” (3).20 Defoe's scene also anticipates Conrad's Marlow as he travels along the Congo River: “I made out deep in the tangled gloom, naked breasts, arms, legs, glaring eyes — the bush was swarming with human limbs in movement, glistening, of bronze colour. The twigs shook, swayed, and rustled, the arrows flew out of them” (46). And just as Conrad's anthropomorphized “bush began to howl” (46), so too does Defoe's people-scape speak an unintelligible language. The pirates heard the Indians halloo, after their Way, to one another, and make a strange Noise more uncouth and inimitably strange, than any they had ever heard, more like the Howling and Barking of wild Creatures in the Woods, than like the voice of Man, only that sometimes they seemed to speak words. (207) Indeed, Singleton's journey resounds with howling. Men howl: "[they] set up the horridest Yell, or Howling” (53);Adventures in Domesticity animals howl: “still more frightful, towards Night we began to hear the Wolves howl, the Lions bellow, and a great many wild Asses braying, and other ugly Noises which we did not understand” (81); all “furious Creatures” howl: “their [sic] was a Noise and Yelling, and Howling, and all sort of such Wilderness Musick on every Side of us” (90), “they heard a doleful Groaning and Howling” (207). Even when there is nothing around to make noise, even when they cannot distinguish the author of this “wilderness Musick," Singleton advances the idea that the wilderness speaks in a distorted language understood by visceral interpretation rather than rational discourse: “It was a vast howling Wilderness, not a Tree, a River, or a Green thing to be seen, for as far as the Eye could look; nothing but a scalding Sand, which, as the Wind blew, drove about in Clouds, enough to overwhelm Man and Beast; nor could we see any End of it” (79). In what Novak has called an “exploitation of the sublime in the form of horrific scenery and equally horrific wild beasts” (“Defoe as Innovator,” 54), the howls of the “wild men” resonate as a wild echo, people and landscape merging again under the roar of inarticulation. Like the clothing that is partly evocative of Englishmen, their language only suggests fully developed speech: "sometimes they seemed to speak words” (207). Singleton's descriptions are in keeping with what Azim has described as a colonial politics of language: “the acquisition of language becomes one of the factors marking man's progress from the state of savagery to domestic and then to more elaborate forms of social and political organisation" (18). Visually and verbally, the relation of the “wild men" resembles what would be considered a frightening form of kinship in Heart of Darkness. Again, Marlow describes Congolese people: “They howled and leaped and spun and made horrid faces, but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity like yours – the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar” (38). For Defoe,“Homely Adventures” language may clarify the distinction between civilized and savage, but the distinction between person and landscape is an ambiguous one, for language is often unstable and barely distinguishable from a beastly cacophony. Like the “subversive nature” of the nebulous distinction between fact and fiction in early-eighteenth-century writing, ambiguous language in Captain Singleton “acts as a comment on all that the massive task of classification and definition cannot incorporate into itself" (Azim 21). Defoe's ambiguous/ambivalent language defies the project of taxonomizing natural histories, blurring the distinction between land and people by literally rending from limb to limb the object of the European scientific scrutiny. As we have seen and again shall see, the sounds of human dismemberment and earthly disruption converge in violent howls. But even murky language is useful, for it is language that locates the natives amid the “howling Noise” that threatens to obscure them: “They knew their enemies and murtherers were above, for they heard them talk” (207-208). Singleton's cohorts grow "enraged to see our selves so baulk'd by a few wild People whom we thought we had safe in our Clutches" (210), the more so since Singleton admits that there is nothing "to be got by the Conquest" (213). Determined to destroy the “Indian Engineering,” William proposes that they penetrate the arboreal garrison: they “bore great Holes into the side of the Tree” and “filled them all with Gun-Powder" (212). The explosive engagement ends in violent ejaculation: “not one of them that were in the Inside could escape, but rather were shot out of the Mouth of the Cave like a Bullet out of a Gun” (214). The scene erupts into a theater of violence and mutilation: "some of them had no Arms, some no Legs, some no Head, some lay half buried in the Rubbish of the Mine” (214). Only after Singleton translates the wild howls into the language of violence, where the “Bushes on the other Side of the little Hill. .. roar” with gunpowder, as if “out of the Mouth of a Cannon"Adventures in Domesticity (213), do the rogues experience the jouissance of their engagement: “We had now our full Satisfaction of the Indians” (214). Although the men couldn't satisfy themselves commercially or sexually, they could martially. Ultimately, the fruition of their sexualized "enterprize” bears mangled fruit and is productive of death and mayhem; this culmination is, in the end, a “losing Voyage" (214). But, in taking account of the adventure, Singleton satisfies himself textually: his account of this episode is perhaps the most egregious example of how he turns a pirate adventure (popularly called “going upon the account”) into a valuable narrative. The conversion of commercial and military losses into narrative gain is a literary (and literal) embodiment of the domestic consumption of exotica that travel literature offered. Defoe critics have commented upon his ability to capitalize on an expanding reading public. Novak, for instance, recognizes the relation between adventure as physical journey and adventure as narrative venture, calling Defoe's writing an "exploration of a variety of forms,” and a “discovery of a particular way of writing prose fiction” (“Defoe as Innovator,” 41; my emphasis). Precursor to the kind of commodity fetish Anne McClintock describes “as the central form of the industrial Enlightenment,” the economics of pirate accounts reveal that the “domestic is political” (32), for the domestic literary trade was flush with accounts of colonial adventure. Laura Brown argues for a similar politicization of the domestic economy when she claims that women were both constituent and symbolic of the need for empire since they wore the products of colonial commerce, justifying the need for trade.22 Though the pirates' wealth is gained in non-Western countries and islands, Singleton's preoccupation with his own literary enterprise situates the novel within England's domestic economy. The lack of gain, read in light of Singleton's agreement with William that “no body trades for the sake of Trading,“Homely Adventures” 49 much less do any Men rob for the sake of Thieving" (256) complicates the “Siege of [the] great Tree” (208). The dispersal of the Indians' dismembered bodies, narrated amid the howls of disrupted and discordant language, refutes Singleton and William's declared piratical intention to “have Money without Fighting (rather than] Fighting without Money" (153). If this fulminating moment of piratical travail, one that rings of colonial commercial travel, is one of costly expenditure, is this indeed, to use Quaker William's phrase, “trade for trade's sake”? The text answers its own question with the success of Singleton's narrative enterprise. Defoe sets the howling speech of the Indians against Singleton's descriptive narration. Parlaying the failed assault into narrative gain (“an Enterprize, the like of which has scarce been ever heard”), Singleton details the mechanics of battle and plods through the pirates' consultations, making more poignant the distinction between inarticulation and excess articulation (208). When Singleton's enemies refuse to communicate with him, offering violence in lieu of speech — "nor would they hold any Correspondence with us, or come near us, but shot at us several Times with Arrows as long as Launces” (205) — Singleton ensures that their hostile articulations are returned. His army fills “the Mouth of the Cave” with gunpowder, the Indians come “roaring out there as out of the Mouth of a Cannon" (213). Ultimately, the visual not-quite of the wild- men becomes a linguistic not-quite that echoes the discursive gaps throughout the novel. Like the rape scene, where Singleton “could never fully get it out of our Men what they did” (218), the elisions hint at a story, often tantalizing with their suggestiveness: "more was done than it is fit to speak of here” (144), “Abundance of little Incidents happened upon this March, which it is not possible to crowd into this Account” (71, passim), or Singleton's description of the “discoloured" Englishman they discover in Africa: “This Account of his would indeed be in it self the Subject of an agreeable History,50 Adventures in Domesticity and would be as long and as diverting as our own, having in it many strange and extraordinary Incidents, but we cannot have room here to launch out into so long a Digression" (123). Singleton truncates or omits parts of his story in defense of the readers' sensibility, but also because the code of piratical journaling precludes him from giving a full relation: “upon the Word of a PYRATE... I shall not be able to recollect the full, no not by far, of the great Variety which has formed one of the most reprobate Schemes that ever Man was capable to present to the World” (139). Thus is the discursive map of Singleton's journal plotted by gaps and absences. On Ceylon, the Indians are not subject to the laws of trade; they are unregulated bodies that scatter like cannon shot. Neither are the pirates subject to the laws that regulate English commerce, though they are former subjects, the bastard offspring of legitimate trading ships and the British Royal Navy." The partial bodies of Indians and the unregulated piratical journal assault the body of official discourse. Hans Turley's claim that “Defoe ... links the economic menace of the pirates to the libertine excesses of the aristocracy, not only through the ways that pirates disrupt the status quo economically but culturally — and implicitly sexually — as well” (203) can be considered in terms of the disruption to discourse and Singleton's efforts to stem the tide of promiscuous language. The wild gaps in articulable speech on Ceylon share narrative consanguinity with the gaps in Singleton's story, pointing not only to the artfulness of Singleton's journal, but also to the monstrous and disruptive results of the generative forces of colonial commerce. Just as Singleton's pirate ships sail through the interstices of legitimate commercial trade routes, Singleton narrates his adventures through the gaps in discourse. He repeatedly claims that he has kept no journal — "I was too young in the Trade to keep any Journal of this Voyage” (4-5), “I can say nothing here to the Manner of our Voyage; for as I“Homely Adventures” said, I kept no Journal” (9, passim) — and that he is too artless and uneducated to lie. He pleads delicacy, secrecy, or lack of time (71, 133, 139, 144, passim) in omitting portions of his tale, in part as testament to the veracity and naturalness of his narrative. But in fact, Singleton is an attentive navigator of his relation, for he is sharply aware that language has the power to “end [pirates'] Journals at the Gallows” (139). Thus the question of how to marry colonial wealth to the British home is also, urgently, the question of how to narrate homely adventures without ending one's “Journal at the Gallows.” By mutually implicating home and adventure in one another, Defoe defies the idea that travel narratives, and hence textual experiences, are safe proxies for the dangerous urges to travel away from the moral epicenter of home. By displacing the specifically sexualized threat of illegitimate travel and its close relative, colonial commerce, onto language, he subverts any claims to safety by the very telling of his tale. In fact, Defoe mocks the sententious authoritative language of discovery just prior to his scene of scattered language. Singleton relates an account of castaways and the discovery of "a little Book” (202), in which is secreted a slip of paper written by Englishmen who have “c[o]me from Greenland, and from the North Pole” (201). The men are stranded in Japan, but this does not compel the pirates. It is not the discovery of text or the existence of Europeans in Japan; rather, Singleton is “amazed ... to discover a Passage that Way into those Parts of the World," a route eagerly sought after by the Dutch and English (202). Moreover, Singleton's focus is not on history or discovery proper, but on travel as a trope for journal (both as narrative and as life-story). William's suggestion that they rescue the Englishmen is rejected by Singleton: "the Vessels were very unhappily sailid, and this put an End to our Enquiry after them, and perhaps may have disappointed Mankind of one of the most noble Discoveries that ever was made, or will again be made in the world, for the Good of Mankind inAdventures in Domesticity general: But so much for that” (202-203). Singleton's compass quickly points away from the direction of the note, not toward it, and the inflated descriptions of lost glory are made ironic by his abrupt dismissal: “But so much for that.” Singleton's interest is directed away from “noble Discoveries,” just as his interests are directed away from legitimate commerce. But, while he refuses to follow any prescripted direction or textual directive, his relationship to legitimacy and authority remains ambiguous, for his trade necessarily corresponds with legitimate trade underwritten by what has been called the “new science” of the eighteenth century. In his reading of this scene, Novak says of William's efforts to rescue the stranded men: “He couches his appeal in a variety of ways, but his real reason - an interest in knowledge — is apparent enough to his pirate audience to allow them to reject his arguments. He is very much the merchant explorer to whom the Royal Society appealed as the kind of person who would prepare the way for both scientific exploration and colonization” (56). Defoe's narrative strategy (the detailed plot description he puts in the mouth of Singleton) was common to the literature of travel. Most eighteenth-century writers viewed the plain-spokenness of the traveler as a rhetorical strategy intended to suggest inherent veracity — that is, the writer is not artful enough to lie. In his introduction to the New Voyage Round the World, Defoe himself writes an indictment of the sailor's literary merit that is intended as an endorsement of his credibility: So as soon as Men have acted the Sailor, they come a-shore and write Books of their Voyage, not only to make a great Noise of what they have done themselves, but pretending to show the way to others to come after them, they set up for Teachers and Chart Makers to Posterity. Tho' most of them have had this Misfortune,“Homely Adventures” that whatever Success they have had in the Voyage, they have had very little in the Relation; except it be to tell us, that a Seaman when he comes to the Press, is pretty much out of his Element, and a very good Sailor may make but a very indifferent Author. (1) Their merit is in their wish to instruct, though they may be wanting in the art of pleasing. Read in light of contemporary mistrust of artful narratives, Defoe's sailor bolsters his ethos because his lack of writerly skill is equated with what Thomas Sprat called a “primitive purity” of language. In his History of the Royal Society (1667), Sprat boasts that the society has effected a "remedy” to the rhetorical “excesses in Natural Philosophy”: there has been, a constant Resolution, to reject all the amplification, digressions, and swellings of style: to return back to the primitive purity, and shortness, when men deliver'd so many things, almost in an equal number of words. They have exacted from all their members, a close, naked, natural way of speaking; positive expressions; clear senses; a native easiness ... and preferring the language of Artizans, Countrymen, and Merchants, before that, of Wits, or Scholars. (113) Sprat's concern for the one-to-one correspondence between words and things recalls Swift's satire on the floating island of Laputa in Gulliver's Travels, where philosophers carry a bag of words as a means of communication. But Sprat's praise of rhetorical simplicity bears national importance for him. Just as geography was said to constitute national character, Sprat asserts that language expresses national character:Adventures in Domesticity If there can be a true character given of the Universal Temper of any Nation under Heaven: then certainly this must be ascrib'd to our Countrymen: that they have commonly an unaffected sincerity; that they love to deliver their minds with a sound simplicity ... that they are more concern'd what others will think of the strength, than of the fineness of what they say. (114) Sprat eagerly anticipated the day when every ship that "come up the Thames” would “make some return of Experiments, as well as of Merchandize” (86), and his natural history of language indicates the kind of value held by narratives of commerce in scientific and political circles. Contemporary critics have retained the opinion that sailing and writing are often antipathetic skills: “one obvious reason for the dearth of great writing is that few people of real literary talent ever went to sea," but the “matter-of-fact writing" brings us the “flesh and blood” of the “real seas," which is “the claim ... this kind of literature ha[s] on our attention” (Edwards 219-20). “Real” experiences merged importantly with their redaction: “His pose becomes a feature of the genre in which his writing develops; it is that of the ordinary man of common sense whose personal observations may be trusted by virtue of his lack of specialist skills (especially literary ones) and his possession of ordinary faculties responsibly exercised in isolation from society” (Dodd 2).24 Rennie expresses more awareness of the sometimes artful nature of professed simplicity: Far-voyagers have a particular relation to the state of “true Nature,” to which it was supposed they traveled, and a particular relation also to a“Homely Adventures” 55 “Plain" language, which must reveal that 'true Nature' to the readers of a civilized culture, in a "naked, natural” way ... Plain language reveals the "true Nature” of things and also the travelers' need to convince the reader of the “true Nature" of the traveler. (60) Thus, to use Rennie's words, Singleton's "particular relation to the state of 'true nature,” is that of violent speech. Here is Sprat's "primitive purity” of language (113) communicated to the reader through the vehicle of artless and valuable narration. The correspondence between "natural" speech and authentic relations is especially poignant in the context of a pirate venture, for it conjures the “trope of 'corrupting purity" (7) that William Epstein identifies. Epstein reads out the literary implications of a “prisonhouse of language” that condemn writing on the basis of “corruption of blood.” The generic and genealogical merge in an economy of authentic identity and pure narration. The trope of disease, here associated with genealogy only vicariously through narrative, will remain a central metaphor for the cultural mixing throughout the eighteenth century. Defoe's manipulation of the conventions of authentic narration anticipates later worry that social commerce with cultural others will alter Englishmen and women in dangerous ways. But as we shall see in the next section, Defoe does not view such social commerce as a threat, but rather as an economic opportunity. Colonial Masquerade I have been arguing that Defoe's novel Captain Singleton renders legible the ways in which multiple meanings converged in the tropes of domestic and home in order to negotiate what it meant to be English during a time of developing international commerce. The myriad connotationsAdventures in Domesticity of "home" were bound up in colonial difference – in the attempt to identify the distinctions among English people, English language, and the bodies and speech of others. I have touched on the commercialization of narrative; both Singleton and Defoe capitalized on the packaging of unique and exotic stories. What follows is an extension of that argument. I hope to demonstrate that what I will call Singleton and William's "colonial masquerade” parallels Defoe's generic adulteration as a capitalization of cultural mixing. One feature of colonial masquerade is that it threatens to alter or mask one's address, the means by which one articulates identity, or, if you will, subjectivity. In the “torrid zones,” colonial masquerade often entailed adapting one's conduct by manipulating dress and address.20 Colonial masquerade is the vehicle by which many of Defoe's characters are able, as David Blewitt notes, “[to) live by their wits, that is, in disguises and through deception" (24). Thus is Captain Singleton's stealthy return to England in Persian voice and costume; Roxana's incognito Turkish costume; Lady Mary Wortly Montagu's “Turkish habit,” the "perpetual Masquerade” she describes in her Turkish Embassy Letters (April 1717); and numerous other moments in early- eighteenth-century writing. For inistance, embedded in “The Voyages and Adventures of Captain Robert Boyle” (1726), an adventure tale that has been (sometimes) attributed to Defoe, is “The History of Mrs. Villars."27 Here, Boyle rescues Villars from the sexual clutches of an Irish partially Muslim-converted pirate who has confined Villars until such time as she will agree to marry him or be raped. Villars gets away under the cloak of a boy's “Moorish dress” purchased from a Jew, and in blackface (67). Villars "submit[s]” to be “disguised in the habit of a man,” (45) a costume in which Boyle dresses her. He says:“Homely Adventures” I took out a paper of ombre, and told her she must permit me to run it over her face and hands; which I did. But the pleasure of touching her in that gentle manner, perfectly put me in an ecstasy, which she observed; for I could not help softly squeezing her hand. She did not seem displeased at my transport. (50-51) Boyles's excitement at blackening her skin and transforming her into a Moorish boy is explosive: “the crisis of my project was very near” (49). Sexual and national identity are erotically dressed up in these sorts of masquerades, where characters capitalize on the signs of colonial difference to travel through faraway lands and to titillate readers. Brown claims that female colonial dress “evokes the spoils of an expansionist culture” (147). Of Defoe's Roxana, Brown says: “Indeed, the outfitting of the English female body in the complete and gorgeous costume of an exotic and exploited other is one dimension of the powerful motif of female dressing that characterizes eighteenth-century imperialist ideology” (148). In Captain Singleton, colonial masquerade represents more than merely the dress of empire. As we shall see, part of Singleton's colonial masquerade is his altered speech. Signaling the importance of language to national identity, Singleton and William's return "home" relies upon the power of language to disguise, and by disguising, to facilitate mobility. Upon his return "home," Singleton masks his illegitimacy by disguising himself and William to “pass for Grecians and foreigners” (277). Adapting his identity via colonial masquerade, he is able to convert illegitimate piratical wealth into legitimate commercial wealth and secure the perpetuation of that legitimacy by adopting legitimate English heirs. He authorizes his English identity by literally buying into the ideal of the English home. But Singleton's58 Adventures in Domesticity masquerade refutes the fiction of the stable English home, showing it to be underwritten by illegitimacy rather than licit domesticity. So, while Singleton's piratical work serves to reinvigorate the English economy, it also refashions the home in homely adventures. More broadly, Defoe's novel exemplifies the way in which English identity in the early eighteenth century was appropriated and commodified. At the close of the novel, William's proposal that they retire from their pirate profession is coupled with a sentimental notion of home, a notion whose meaning is considered to be so obvious that Singleton must explain his confusion about the term: “Well, William, said I, but now you think you have laid your Preliminary at first so home, that I should have nothing to say; that is, that when I had got Money enough, it would be natural to think of going Home” (256). Here, home means domestic residence, but also signifies clarity; a “Preliminary .. . so home" is a statement of plain meaning. But Singleton's account of home does not square with Quaker William's, and he doubts the implicit relation between the wealth of foreign adventures and home, questioning not just the assumptions that underlie a notion of home, but its very definition. Singleton's enormous economic success, coupled with his reluctance to return to England, where he is “destitute” of connections, suggests that his facility in engaging with the commercial world is related to his difficulty in translating that bounty into a discrete and coherent English identity. At the end of his journal, he considers how to resolve his newly felt repentance and his "hankering after home” (256), leading “a vagrant Life, among Infidels, Turks, Pagans, and such Sort of People” (268), alone but for his constant companion, William. William is “anxious" about Singleton's uncontrollable speech, and becomes his bedfellow in order to better survey the expenditure of words, for Singleton's conscience made him cry out in his sleep: “I am a Thief, a Pirate, a Murtherer, and ought to be hanged" (269). Singleton's "disorder" (269) is controlled“Homely Adventures" 59 by his keen and manipulative “governor,” as bent upon protecting Singleton's tongue from inappropriate activity as chaperones of young virgins were concerned to protect their charges' bodies from inappropriate sexual activity: “William was very anxious ever after about my talking in my sleep, and took care to lye with me always himself, and to keep me from Lodging in any House, where so much as a Word of English was understood” (270). William rationalizes their pirate wealth, "quieting” Singleton, who finds “a great deal of Satisfaction in William's Discourse” (270). Here, language is as malleable as the bits of metal shaped by Singleton's cutler for the purpose of sexual and material barter in Africa. While Defoe demonstrates the difficulty of containing words, he also implies that speaking can be charted and controlled so that one can successfully navigate discursive travels. Their satisfaction with language is portrayed as safer than the transgression of homosexuality implied by Singleton's night speech.28 The two adopted “brothers” conceal their identity while they map out their plan to return to England: we had now cloathed our selves here after the Persian Manner, in long Vests of Silk, a Gown or Robe of English Crimson Cloth, very fine and handsome, and had let our Beards grow so after the Persian Manner, that we past for Persian Merchants, in View only, tho', by the Way, we could not understand or speak one Word of the Language of Persia. (264) Singleton's masquerade dress folds back on itself, for he is an Englishman cloaked in Persian dress that is composed partly of English cloth. The materials of colonial commerce threaten to disguise “natural-borne Englishmen,” oddly enough, even with goods originating from the motherland. The materials for enacting the performance of this colonial masquerade areAdventures in Domesticity provided by a Dutch merchant: “the Dutchman supply'd all this for us, and as we had resolved to keep our selves as retired as we could, though there were several English Merchants upon the Place, yet we never acquainted our selves with one of them, or exchanged a Word with them” (264-65). The sartorial conversion demonstrates that “Singleton's pirates," as Laura Brown claims, “are interchangeable with traders” (164). It further illustrates that Defoe "practices an economic nationalism thoroughly qualified by a poetics of race and religion” (Dharwadkar 69). Hence, Defoe's economy of colonial commerce is also an economy of colonial difference, where men exchange markers of identity, and identity emerges as something available for purchase. Singleton's journey home is facilitated by a series of colonial masquerades. Colonial masquerade disguises and even hybridizes not only the body (where cultural markers of the body, such as facial hair, are enlisted in the service of concealment), but also the body of text that is Singleton's journal. The two men conceal themselves in Venice as well: We kept our selves here incognito for a great while, passing for Two Armenian Merchants still, as we had done before; and by this Time we had gotten so much of the Persian and Armenian Jargon, ... as was sufficient to make us able to talk to one another, so as not to be understood by anybody, though sometimes hardly by our selves. (272) Singleton's most successful trade has been in words, for while he does not “exchange a Word” with English traders, his African peregrination, his piracy, and his return home all depend upon his ability to disguise, interpret, and translate language. Here, travel is a trope for unregulated, promiscuous language. Thus while masquerade alters one's dress, colonial"Homely Adventures” masquerade alters one's address, and one of the risks of colonial masquerade is that it threatens to render unintelligible the identity and discourse of the masquerader, even to oneself.29 Just before returning to England, Singleton and William parlay their goods into ready cash, a transaction so legitimate that Singleton says it "might be called the only trading voyage we made, and now we were very rich” (255). Recall that when William charted their course for England, he suggested that his sentimental notion of home was the “natural” destination for their wealth, averring “no body trades for the sake of Trading” (256). Here, "trade” sustains several simultaneous meanings. Their final “trading voyage” exchanges goods to enable an exchange in identity; Singleton and William trade in their Englishness – that is, they exchange it for the masquerade of a Persian identity. By particularizing the exchange, identity itself is deconstructed, and shown to be an amalgam of facial hair, dress, and words. Their final masquerade recalls an earlier moment in Singleton's journey, when his cutler traded articulated designs of African animals for sexual and commercial liberties, demonstrating that the representation of the animals was more valuable than the animals themselves. Similarly, Singleton and William become a representation of themselves; their identity is visual, and within the confines of his journal, it is also only discursive. Like the goods of colonial travel - sugar, coffee, slaves – words have currency, and language must be negotiated. They are not beholden to anyone; they can be bought and sold, not fully invested or divested of meaning, but nuanced, like the multiformity of goods and ships they encounter during their careers as pirates. For instance, sailing in the Persian Gulf, Singleton “spy'd a Ship” whose national identity was unclear to him at first look: “Indeed I thought at first it had been an English Ship, but it appeared to be an European freighted for a Voyage from Goa, on the coast ofAdventures in Domesticity Malabar, to the Red Sea, and was very rich ... We found her Manned with Portuguese Seaman, but under the Direction of five Merchant Turks” (174-75). A ship's nationality can be ambiguous, and even when it is discernable, it is peopled with a polyglot of men and goods. They next “chopp'd upon a Booty” with a ship “of Bengal, belonging to the Great Mogul's Country, but had on board a Dutch Pilot, ... and several European Seamen, whereof three were English, ... some Malabars, and some others. There were five Indian Merchants on board, and some Armenian, ... and a Jew of Goa" (176). The polymorphous forms and cacophonous voices that people this narrative suggest the kind of “internal stratification" Mikhail Bakhtin describes as the inherent defiance of the novel: The novel can be defined as a diversity of social speech types (sometimes even diversity of languages) and a diversity of individual voices, artistically organized. The internal stratification of any single national language into social dialects, characteristic group behavior, professional jargons, generic languages, languages of generations and age groups, tendentious languages, languages of the authorities, of various circles and of passing fashions, languages that serve the specific sociopolitical purposes of the day, even of the hour ... - this internal stratification present in every language at any given moment of its historical existence is the indispensable prerequisite for the novel as a genre. (263) If travel writers often negotiated multiple subject positions, it is curious that John James Heidegger and Theresa Cornelys, the “main sponsor[s] of masquerades in London"“Homely Adventures” were both “accused of being foreign adventurers" (Castle 10, 11). Masquerade was associated with colonial commercial travel, and both aroused similar worries. I would argue that as "masquerade pleasure became a commodity” (Castle 11), so too did identity become a commodity. And just as masquerades sparked fear of sexual license, sº so too did piracy and trade in the torrid zones excite anxiety about promiscuity and transgressive, contagious sexuality. The changeable identity of the mask bore some resemblance to the travel writer in that masks, novels, and travel narratives all commodified the subject. The reader was invited not only to identify the masked subject, but to identify with the writing/masking subject, so that travel narratives and novels encouraged their readers to share in the performance of identity. The multiple masquerades in the early novels of Defoe (both Defoe posing as someone else and his characters' impersonations) and in many travel narratives bear witness to the extent of cultural creolizing initiated through the expansion of print culture and colonial commerce. Englishmen were not just wearing and seeing signs of otherness in masked assemblies," but they were reading about it in novels and travel narratives. In the end, William's sister, a widow with four children, enables Singleton and William to return "incognito" to England. Their wealth will filter through her, and she will resolve the central problem of Singleton's journal: that of marrying (and correcting discursively) illegitimate colonial wealth to the putative legitimacy of the English countryside. After sending her five thousand pounds, Singleton mitigates any potential distress over the threat of taint attached to his money: You may think, perhaps, that I was very prodigal of my ill-gotten Goods, thus to load a Stranger with my Bounty, ... But my Condition ought to be considered in this case; though IAdventures in Domesticity had Money to Profusion, yet I was perfectly destitute of a Friend in the World, ... or knew not either where to dispose or trust any Thing I had while I lived, or whom to give it to, if I died. (276) His choice of words is telling, for "prodigal” signifies a returned wanderer as well as one who is wasteful. Singleton's wealth stands in for the dangerous excesses of colonial enterprise. His “ill-gotten goods” are an ill-begotten inheritance, his bastard wealth, and his problem is one of disbursement and inheritance. Singleton intends that his marriage to William's sister will be his last “homely" adventure. He defines home for the first time as “a kind of a Centre, to which I should tend in my future Actions; for really a Man that has a Subsistence, and no Residence, no Place that has a Magnetick Influence upon his Affections, is in one of the most odd uneasy Conditions in the World” (276). But although he denies the commodification of home space — "nor is it in the Power of all his Money to make it up to him” (276) — all of his relations with William's sister are described in economic terms. He “resolve[s] to make her the Object of my first Bounty," so that he may "purchase something of a Refuge for my self" (276). But his return is conditional; neither he nor William will speak English in public, and they will continue their colonial masquerade, disguising themselves with beards and dress so they might "pass for Grecians and Foreigners” (277). Thus has masquerade transported his adventures to a home in England, though he may not speak or dress as if he belonged to that country. Their masquerade makes home the uncharted territory, where language and appearance are yoked together in an illegitimate union. When Defoe recasts his pirate adventurer as a rural domestic husband, he challenges the notion of a“Homely Adventures" sentimental home by raising the specter of illegitimacy. Singleton and William's colonial dress, their ill-gotten wealth, and their multilinguality are the trappings of their “hybridized" lives. In theorizing “hybridity” in Victorian English culture, Robert Young looks back to Defoe's “mongrel” pride in the True-Born Englishman: "the English did not transform themselves so easily into the imagined community of a homogeneous national identity. In fact, it became increasingly common in the later nineteenth century for the English to invoke Defoe's account of that Het'rogeneous Thing, An Englishman,' and to define themselves as a hybrid or ‘Mongrel half-bred Race” (17). Defoe's True-Born Englishman certainly applauded what twentieth-century Americans would call a melting pot, but Singleton's disguise indicates his detachment from English society and the failure to absorb his colonial adventures into the narrative of English identity. Patchwork and pidgin conversation also demonstrate the inadequacy of a model that posits home against adventure, and suggests a more fluid notion of national identity. When Singleton stems the tide of William's sentimental plea to return to England, calling his pirate ship “home,” he simultaneously refuses the national or emotional claim of a country that did not embrace him: Why, says William, looking a little confused, art not thou an Englishman? Yes, says I, I think so, you see I speak English; but I came out of England a Child, and never was in it but once since I was a man, and then I was cheated and imposed upon, and used so ill, that I care not if I never see it more. (256-57) For Singleton, even membership in a language community is insufficient to the task of instilling that pride and desire that William assumes home will naturally inspire. Further, his66 Adventures in Domesticity disavowal of England sets the homely economy of the pirate ship against the harsh economic realities of legitimate trade. Piracy, especially in the earlier part of the century, before the Royal Navy gained some control over freebooting, held out the promise of a more equitable distribution of goods than did service for the Crown." It is fitting, then, that Singleton, who has no great opinion of the respectability of nation-sanctioned trade, and the social practices that undergird it, does not have a true change of heart to accompany his change of dress and address. Singleton can play the rural domestic husband, but only because his colonial masquerade — the outer trappings of respectability — are proof that the domestic home is something of a sham.

For a nuanced reading of the multiple meanings of "adventure” in Robinson Crusoe, see Peter Hulme, Colonial Encounters: Europe and the Native Caribbean 1492-1797 (New York: Methuen, 1986), pgs. 182- 84. Scholars who read Defoe's fiction against travel writing often do so in the context of genre studies or canon-formation studies. Arthur Wellesly Secord's Studies in the Narrative Method of Defoe (New York: Russell & Russell, 1963), J. Paul Hunter's The Reluctant Pilgrim (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1966), and G. A. Starr's Defoe and Casuistry (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1971) connect Defoe's travel writing to narrative method, the Puritan guide tradition,68 Adventures in Domesticity and spiritual biography respectively. In Travel Writing and the Evolution of the Novel (New York: Dover, 1962), Percy Adams connects novels to travel writing through the works of Defoe. Max Novak's Economics and the Fiction of Daniel Defoe (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1962) situates Defoe's fiction within the discourse of commercial propaganda. Scholars of colonialism have considered Defoe's fiction in a variety of contexts. Martin Green's Dreams of Adventure, Deeds of Empire (New York: Basic Books, 1979) reads Defoe's work as adventures of empire; Brown's Ends of Empire reads Defoe's work as participating in an economy of colonial difference that sets up the figure of the female as decoy for commercial exploitation; in “Nation, Race, and the Ideology of Commerce" (Eighteenth Century 30.1 [1998]), Aparna Dharwadker argues that Defoe's “mercantilist positions are mediated by the quasi-imperial discourses of nation and race" (64). J. A. Downie, in “Defoe, Imperialism, and the Travel Books Reconsidered,” in Critical Essays on Daniel Defoe, ed. Roger D. Lund (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1997), has worried that “there is now a danger that we will end up by relegating travel and adventure into an almost invisible role in the narrative structure” (77). He raises the question of source studies in order to argue that Defoe's fiction functioned as colonialist propaganda. Feminist critics like Jane Spencer and Nancy Armstrong have argued for the centrality of women writers and domesticity to the rise of the novel. Armstrong has claimed that “the rise of the novel was related to the emergence of women's writing” (“Some Call It Fiction,” in Feminisms, ed. Warhol and Price Herndl, 914); see also Armstrong, Desire and Domestic Fiction: A Political History of the Novel (New York: Oxford University Press, 1987). Postcolonial critics have extended that argument, claiming that colonial sexuality and domesticity underwrote eighteenth- and nineteenth-century“Homely Adventures” discourse. Edward Said claims that “[w]ithout empire... there is no European novel as we know it” (Culture and Imperialism [New York: Random House, 1994), 69). In Gayatri Spivak's essay, “Three Women's Texts and a Critique of Imperialism,” in Feminisms, ed. Warhol and Price Herndl, she writes: "It should not be possible to read nineteenth-century British literature without remembering that imperialism, understood as England's social mission, was a crucial part of the cultural representation of England to the English” (896); and Firdous Azim, in The Colonial Rise of the Novel (New York: Routledge, 1993), has claimed that "the novel is an imperial genre” (30). See also Brown, Ends of Empire; Robert Young, Colonial Desire: Hybridity in Theory, Culture and Race (New York: Routledge, 1995); Azim The Colonial Rise of the Novel; Anne McClintock, Imperial Leather: Race, Gender and Sexuality in the Colonial Context (New York, Routledge, 1995). For a summary of ideas surrounding the critical reconsideration of the public/ private split that structured the ideology of separate spheres, see Lawrence Klein, “Gender and the Public Private Distinction in the Eighteenth Century: Some Questions About Evidence and Analytic Procedure,” Eighteenth-Century Studies 29.1 (1996): 97-109. Defoe's generic adulteration strangely parallels contemporary Defoe criticism, which uses the language of genealogy and adulteration to describe literature. Critics have been troubled by what William Epstein identified as a problem of “recognition.” Defoe scholars have raged riot over their inability to distinguish a "true” account from a “fictional” one. Epstein explains that "recognition is an activity generated by the relationship between reading and genre” (2). But it is also the "authority genre assumes as it collects and separates information” (2). Defoe frustrates critics by denying them theAdventures in Domesticity power of definition. In Travelers and Travel Liars, Percy Adams blasts Defoe for the ambiguity of fact and fiction. Not content to call him a mere liar, Adams charges Defoe with epistemological criminality: “[he is) an anarchist, whose books almost completely destroy truth” (3). He claims that Defoe's political duplicity – in working as a spy for both Whigs and Tories — is what likely enabled him to have "a mask for every occasion” (107). In “Fiction and Mendacity," the appendix to Defoe and Casuistry G.A. Starr counters Novak's theory of Defoe's fiction as a “defense of lying” with the assertion that Defoe makes "a traditional distinction between lying and beneficial deception" (201). David Blewitt views mendacity as central to Defoe's fiction: “when at the age of nearly sixty Defoe came to write his first novel, the use of disguise and deception for literary purposes had become a habit of mind” (12). I develop this claim in the next chapter, where I offer a reading of the Creole figure in Richard Cumberland's play, The West Indian. 10 For further discussion of Oroonoko as an in-between figure, see Azim's “Slavery and Sexuality in Oroonoko” in The Colonial Rise of the Novel; Brown's “The Romance of Empire: Oroonoko and the Trade in Slaves” in Ends of Empire; and “Petting Oroonoko” in Aravamudan's Tropicopolitans. 11 In Ends of Empire, Brown claims that “mercantile capitalist ideology at this point in its development in England is formulated around gender division” (19). For further discussion of sexuality, gender, and colonialism, see Felicity Nussbaum's Torrid Zones: Maternity, Sexuality, and Empire in Eighteenth-Century English Narratives (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1995); Mary Louise Pratt's Imperial Eyes:Travel Writing and Transculturation (New York:“Homely Adventures" Routledge, 1992); Robert Young's Colonial Desire: Hybridity in Theory, Culture and Race (New York: Routledge, 1995), chapter 7: “Colonialism and the Desiring Machine”; David Spurr's The Rhetoric of Empire: Colonial Discourse in Journalism, Travel Writing, and Imperial Administration (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1993), chapter 11: “Eroticization: The Harems of the West"; Sara Mill's Discourses of Difference: An Analysis of Women's Travel Writing and Colonialism (New York: Routledge, 1991), chapter 2: “Gender and the Study of Colonial Discourse." 12 12 Brown, Ends of Empire, 163. This claim would not hold for other novels by Defoe, in particular for Robinson Crusoe, where use-value is the only value on his island. Dharwadkan, “Nation, Race, and the Ideology of Commerce,” 68-69. Dharwadkan cites from Defoe's Review (8.19.71). Since Defoe stopped writing the Review in 1713, “Bubbl'd” does not evoke the South Sea Bubble of 1720. For a discussion of expansive and improved travel conditions, see Paul Langford, A Polite and Commercial People: England 1727-1783 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), chapter 9: “New Improvements: Turnpikes — Canals - Urban growth – Urban improvement - Agricultural improvement — Enclosure, engrossing, and rural paternalism – Harvest and shortages — Price inflation - Resisting the price rise.” As Laura Brown has noted, in Captain Singleton, “women and natives are defined by their relation to trade” (17). For a more extensive discussion of “the representation of women as the basis for an exploration of the discursive relation between gender and empire,” see her chapter 5: “Amazons and Africans: Daniel Defoe” in Ends of Empire.Adventures in Domesticity " Annette Kolodny's The Lay of the Land: Metaphor as Experience and History in American Life and Letters (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1975) inaugurates a body of scholarship that analyzes the way in which discovery texts often feminized colonized or frontier landscape. 17 See Said, Culture and Imperialism. Jonathan Swift's yahoos in Gulliver's Travels are perhaps the best known eighteenth-century literary distillation of travelers' account of "Hottentots” and other Africans described as brutish. My ideas here are informed by Homi Bhabha's work on ambivalence and hybridity, especially “Signs Taken for Wonders: Questions of Ambivalence and Authority under a Tree Outside Delhi, May 1817," Critical Inquiry 12 (Autumn 1985); "the colonial presence is always ambivalent, split between its appearance as original and authoritative and its articulation as repetition and difference ... It is a difference produced within the act of enunciation as a specifically colonial articulation of those two disproportionate sites of colonial discourse and power: the colonial scene as the invention of historicity, mastery, mimesis or as the 'other scene' of Entstellung, displacement, fantasy, psychic defence, and an 'open' textuality" (150). William Snelgrave, A New Account of Some Parts of Guinea and the Slave Trade (London: Frank Cass, 1971). The conflation of land with people as a description of what he sees as overpopulation is tied to a discussion of polygamy (a practice commonly invoked to demonstrate the putative sexual barbarity of Africans) and is meant to assuage concerns over"Homely Adventures” the slave trade: there are enough people to spare. See especially Snelgrave's discussion of polygamy in Book II. 21 Aravamudan provides an incisive reading of piracy situated within England's colonial economy. See his chapter on Defoe, “Piratical Accounts,” in Tropicopolitans. See “Capitalizing on Women: Dress, Aesthetics, and Alexander Pope" in Brown, Ends of Empire. Brown writes: “Mercantile capitalism itself, with all of its attractions as well as its ambiguous consequences, is attributed to women, whose marginality allows them to serve, in the writings of celebrants and satirists alike, as a perfect proxy or scapegoat. And perhaps even more important, female adornment becomes the main cultural emblem of commodity fetishism” (119). According to Marcus Reddiker, "regardless of their methods, pirates necessarily came from seafaring employments, whether the merchant service, the navy, or privateering” (260). Marcus Reddiker, The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1987). 24 24 There is a strange vacillation about the importance of the narrator to the structure of the travel narrative. J. A. Downie in “Defoe, Imperialism, and the Travel Books Reconsidered,” Critical Essays, ed. Lund, (1997) claims that “in conventional travel literature, ... it was a more or less rigid rule that a travel writer must not talk about himself " (82). He cites Batten's Pleasurable Instruction as authoritative. But Casey Blanton (1997) asserts the opposite: “What matters for travel literature is the sense ... of an intense personal experience mediating our response ... The narrator becomes a character whose responses we can feel, made more urgent by the use of the personal pronoun “I” (9). Many travel writers agreed with that sentiment. Joseph Hawkins' preface to hisAdventures in Domesticity 1796 A History of a Voyage to the Coast of Africa (London: Frank Cass, 1970) is a not uncommon example of this belief: “Readers of travels like travellers are rarely satisfied, till they know some particulars of those with whom they are about to embark, in pursuit of advantage or pleasure: without this knowledge, some dissatisfaction, or doubt, will frequently take place in their minds. In this view therefore it is that I think proper to introduce a few particulars concerning myself” (11). See William Epstein, Recognizing Biography (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1987), 7-9. Epstein writes: “Traditionally, the desire to remain uncorrupted by criticism has been allied with what has been seen as a ‘natural tendency of the genre itself: the promotion of an ongoing sanitation project designed to cleanse and disinfect the organism” (8). Within this context, he claims that “to criticize is to corrupt," and he describes the “legal principle” of blood corruption that disqualifies a person from property inheritance rights if found guilty of a crime. Given that inheritance was transmitted through "blood lines,” a criminal “corruption of the blood” is an apt biological metaphor for one's legal status and here, for the status of a generic "family.”. 26 The erotics of colonial dress are precursor to the desire for and threat of miscegenation that would so trouble social theorists later in the century. In my second chapter, I connect social fears of miscegenation and creolization to the economics of plantation slavery. See that chapter for further discussion. The English Short Title Catalogue lists William Rufus Chetwood (d. 1766) as the author, though every one of the numerous editions cites Benjamin Victor (d. 1778) and Defoe as other authors to whom the work has been attributed. The first edition (1726) lists no author on the title page, and it isn't until the 1776 edition, the eighth edition printed in London,“Homely Adventures” 75 that the dedication is “signed” by Chetwood (bearing in mind that he died ten years previously). The first edition appears to have sold itself as an "authentic” travel narrative; the full title page reads as follows: “The VOYAGES and ADVENTURES of Captain Robert Boyle, In several Parts of the World. Intermix'd with The STORY of Mrs. VILLARS, an English Lady with whom he made his surprizing Escape from Barbary; The HISTORY of an Italian Captive; and the Life of Don Pedro Aquilio, &c. Full of various and amazing Turns of Fortune. / To which is added, The Voyage, Shipwreck, and Miraculous Preservation, of Richard Castleman, Gent. With a Description of the City of Philadelphia, and the Country of Pensylvania./ LONDON: Printed for JOHN WATTS, at the Printing-Office in Wild-Court, near Lincolns-Inn Fields 1726.” Percy Adams judges that it is a novel and that it is not penned by Defoe. He relies on (what I would call questionable) internal “evidence ... [to] determine with a high degree of certainty which of the apocryphal voyages belong to the Defoe canon and which of those that have been attributed to him must be kept out, as, for example, Signor Rozelli, Robert Boyle, and Mother Ross” (Travelers and Travel Liars 1660–1800 [New York: Dover, 1962], 116). 28 See Hans Turley, “Piracy, Identity, and Desire in Captain Singleton,” Eighteenth-Century Studies 31.2 (Winder 1997–98), for a discussion of the homoerotially charged relationship between Singleton and William. Singleton's perilous colonial masquerade is precursor to, proxy for, and condensation of the widely discussed and dreaded threat of cultural mixing embodied by miscegenation. 30 a 30 The association of sexual promiscuity with masking is visible in eighteenth-century romance novels by Eliza Haywood and Mary Davys, to name only two. In Henry76 Adventures in Domesticity Fielding's Amelia, which I read as a kind of female antipicaresque that uses travel as a trope for virtue, the masquerade scene poses a danger to Amelia's virtue. 31 Terry Castle's Masquerade and Civilization: The Carnivalesque in Eighteenth-Century English Literature and Culture (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1986) very briefly addresses the “vogue for Oriental masquerade” (61). Castle rejects the idea that orientalist masquerade is a "displacement of imperialist fantasy," claiming instead that the "exotic costumes marked out a kind of symbolic interpenetration with difference” that resulted in a kind of "recognition” or a "collective ... utopian projection" (61-62). My view of colonial masquerade suggests a more material engagement with cultural difference. Rather than view exotic dress as a "utopian” fantasy, I view such moments as an enactment of ever-creolizing material conditions in England. 32 Sea. See Reddiker, Between the Devil and the Deep BlueChapter 2 Domesticating the Colonial Heart: Sentimentalizing Colonial Difference in Richard Cumberland's The West Indian In the late eighteenth century, the coherence of England's domestic identity was troubled by colonial contact. Creolization, miscegenation, and the rise of the planter class disrupted both economic and marriage markets, notions of female virtue, and the purity of English lineage. Interracial sexual relations were the subject of numerous natural histories, political pamphlets, and travel narratives, which were published during the heyday of didactic domestic fiction. This connection is crucial, for domesticity, particularly concern over female virtue, was not confined exclusively to the English home, as some critics have asserted. Rather, sexuality and domesticity were the political affair of colonial commerce writ large across eighteenth-century fiction. In particular, sentimental fiction often worked to resolve colonialism's anxieties by incorporating worry about commerce and sexuality into its domestic plots. Sentimentality argued for the primacy and supremacy of the English domestic home. It lauded, as in Oliver Goldsmith's sentimental poem “The Traveller," images such as “the smooth current of domestic joy.” But the currents of domesticity were not always smooth, particularly during a century that underwent dramatic demographic and socialAdventures in Domesticity changes brought about by the rapid expansion of internal and international travel. Travel was responsible for the changing shape of the domestic home, and it was often the work of sentimental and colonial writing to address the social changes wrought by new forms of domesticity. As travel and transportation became ever more accessible during the century, writers focused on the potentially ill effects of contact with cultures that could contaminate the purity not only of English traditions, but specifically the purity of English virtues. If the adventures of colonialism posed the threat of travel, sentimental fiction often converted perceived sexual and commercial dangers into travel's promise of domestic virtue. These concerns were staged in Richard Cumberland's play, The West Indian. Wildly popular when it opened in 1771, it was performed throughout the rest of the century. In spite of its title, the play is treated as a sentimental comedy and is not usually analyzed in terms of colonial relations and race.“ Cumberland's play turns upon the sexual conversion (from passionate lover to domestic husband) of Belcour, Stockwell's legitimate but hitherto unclaimed Creole son. Belcour's legitimation is dependent upon his marital choice and is symbolic of the relationship of England to her colonies: both Belcour and West Indian colonies were viewed as needing sexual and cultural regulation. The extensive taxonomies of racial identity compiled by natural historians like Edward Long, Bryan Edwards, Thomas Jefferson, le Comte de Buffon, and others were important to property and civil laws. The establishment of these became an increasingly public concern as travel and trade with West Indian plantations resulted in an ever more visible black population in England and an increased social commerce between Creole planters and the English. As a result, antimiscegenation statutes underwrote a large portion of property and slave law and gave rise to a sexual and legal equation that figured in literature as much as it did in civil dialogue.Domesticating the Colonial Heart 79 Plantation owner Edward Long> published his three- volume History of Jamaica in 1774, two years after the famous and widely discussed Somerset case which adjudged West Indian slaves free once on English soil.“ This case ensured that the public's attention was turned to the question of plantation slavery, and Long capitalized on the publicity, devoting a large portion of his manuscript to a defense of the slave trade. He also addressed in detail the development of a class of Creoles, or white “permanent natives” (262) and the problems he saw arising from travel between the colonies and England. In particular, he feared the consequences of cultural mixing and miscegenation (racial mixing). While Long had great respect for planters, he feared that interracial sexual relations would threaten the purity of English culture and property lines. He worried that miscegenation in the West Indies could eventually result in a dispersal of property to blacks or mulattos and would ill-serve the white English women who were the rightful spouses and mothers of English men (2: 330-31). Long's fears, and indeed the dynamic of the slave economy, were predicated upon what Robert Young has called an economy of “colonial desire.” O Long's obsessions demonstrate how “the cultural construction of race has always been fuelled by the corrupt conjunction of ... hybridized sexual and economic discourses” (Young 158). Not surprisingly, Long's extended concentration on sexual practices and reproduction was directly related to property ownership. Of the history of English marriage, he writes: the institution of marriage is regarded as one of the main links of society, because it is found to be the best support of it. A promiscuous intercourse and an uncertain parentage, if they were universal, would soon dissolve the frame of the constitution, from the infirmity of claims and contested rights of succession; for this80 Adventures in Domesticity reason, the begetting an illegitimate child is reputed a violation of the social compacts, and the transgressors are punishable with corporal correction (2: 325). Long laments the loosening of civil retribution: "the leniety however of the English law at present, is satisfied only with excluding them (illegitimate children] from inheritance, and with exacting a competent provision for their maintenance, that they may not become chargeable upon the publick” (2: 325). His concern is that miscegenation will harm the public by threatening the absolute hegemony of white men over property. Thus sexuality, as Long saw it, was a very public issue, one that lay at the heart of the constitutional fabric of the civil state, and he deemed it logical that civil codes should regulate sexual behavior. Sexual propriety protected not only property rights, but also national identity, which, Long believed, could be secured at the “breast of the legislature” (2: 327). Linda Colley has noted how pervasive was this sentiment. In the narrative of British nationalism, the late-eighteenth-century Englishwoman was charged with the important task of “breast-feeding ... her children into patriotic virtue” (239). Thus when Long laments “the present state of fornication in the island” (2: 333), and acknowledges that it would be absurd to expect white men to refrain “from this commerce" (2: 333), it is fitting that he uses the language of trade to define interracial sexual contact. Sexual, economic, and colonial commerce were all related, and Long's history is but one of many narratives that addressed and often conflated these concerns in relation to national identity.' This regulation of property via rules governing plantation sexuality overlapped with a set of normalized sexual relations prescribed by both sentimental and domestic literature in England. Like the texts Mary Louise Pratt calls “anti- conquest,” Cumberland's play enjoins his reader to view theDomesticating the Colonial Heart business of colonial difference as a sentimental pleasure belonging to the realm of domesticity. “Anti-conquest” is the means by which "science and sentiment code the imperial frontier in the two eternally clashing and complementary languages of bourgeois subjectivity” (39), all in a move that “secure[s] their innocence in the same moment as they assert European hegemony” (7). As Pratt asserts, the authorizing gesture of sentiment was that it naturalized socially constructed systems of power without appearing to do so. Reworking the trope of the passionate Creole into the manageable figure of domestic husband, the sentimental script effectively converts sexual adventures into homely adventures. As we have seen, in early-eighteenth-century fictions, like Defoe's Captain Singleton, characters benefited from dressing up in the signs of colonial difference. By 1771, when The West Indian first appeared, characters began to be valued for their assimilation into an idealized bourgeois identity. Perhaps because of an increasingly visible black presence in London, stories of colonial contact were frequently enacted on the domestic stage. Writers would home in on the threats of colonial contact in order to render them benign. By questioning not just the relation between foreign adventures and the domestic home, but also the semantic opacity of those terms, we are able to interrogate fictions of supposedly discrete and authentic Englishness, and correspondingly challenge the assertion of a domestic narrative of English culture as separate from a colonial narrative of the cultures of darker others. The normalizing force of sentiment in Cumberland's play is exemplary of the way such literary renderings endeavored to yield up narratives of a coherent and authentic English identity. Domesticating adventure and rendering the domestic open to exploration, Cumberland extends the sexual logic of sensibility to incorporate questions of race into the language of sentiment. In the eighteenth century, “the terms 'sentiment,' 'sensibility,' 'sentimentality,' and 'sentimentalism' areAdventures in Domesticity counters in ... literature and philosophy, sometimes representing precise formulations and sometimes vaguely suggesting emotional qualities. They were at home in the scientific or epistemological treatise and in the familiar letter. Often such terms were used interchangeably."9 At different times throughout the century, sensibility and sentimentalism were appropriated by various political, philosophical, or literary movements, and as a result, the terms and their meanings were, in some respects, hopelessly miscegenated. For instance, the ideological work of sensibility was to instruct readers to have emotional responses appropriate to a rationally sensitive mind." According to the logic of sensibility, virtue was attainable through the individual, though it had a necessarily public component. The primacy of the individual in sentimental discourse had to be tempered with publicly affirmed notions of a hierarchy because to suggest that each individual really had access to morality and virtue through the self exclusively would threaten to level class and race distinctions. Thus, oddly progressive in advocating the individual's powers of discernment, sentimentalism often worked to maintain social hierarchies. In the late eighteenth century, Cumberland's audience would have understood sensibility/sentimentalism as a (feminized) domesticating force that signaled both natural virtue and cultural superiority. Many critics have noted the relation between abolition and sentimentality. Pratt connects the rise in abolitionist political activity to the rise in popularity of travel literature in order to account for the way “sentimentality consolidated itself quite suddenly in the 1780s and 1790s as a powerful mode for representing colonial relations and the imperial frontier” (87). Her connection is important, but while critics have analyzed the use of sensibility in the service of abolition," less has been said about the similar usages of colonial figures by both abolitionists and proslavery apologists. Sentimentality was used to create colonial figures from Creoles to noble savages toDomesticating the Colonial Heart brute beasts and cruel overseers. It was used also to sexualize or sterilize, to frighten or placate – both by pro- and antislavery writers.13 Sentimentality provided a way to dictate public norms while appearing to concentrate solely on the individual. This meant that the business of colonial sexuality could be couched in a rhetoric of moral virtue that claimed to filter, but somehow transcend, material conditions. For instance, many natural historians and fiction writers endorsed the tenets of colonial patriarchy by promoting the trope of the benevolent patriarch whose sentimental virtues and reasonable dictates embody the ideal authority figure.!4 Sentimental portraits of individual figures or of plantation and domestic English life were painted as a means of regulating sexuality and of maintaining racialized social hierarchies. Fictional representations of West Indians — Creoles and Africans — were informed largely by images of the Caribbean, Africa, and the slave trade made popular in travel narratives and natural histories. As secretary to the Board of Trade, Cumberland was well versed in the prevailing stereotypes of West Indians and in the very public conversations about slavery and commerce that made Creole and African figures standard fare for audience consumption. In Guinea's Captive Kings, Wylie Sypher explains how economic concerns influenced negative stereotypes of planters: "the ‘Creole,' as he was called, was an odious figure in the eyes of most. As the price of sugar rose ... ostentatiously moneyed planters overran British society. This society, thoroughly local in its preferences, resented such characters as Thackeray painted in Miss Swartz — a 'black' heiress” (86)." Fear of economic competition from planters was often articulated in racist terms. This racialist narrative of economic encroachment thus echoed a narrative of domestic and virtuous English womanhood. Cultural creolization and miscegenation were depicted as similarly menacing. The planter Creole84 Adventures in Domesticity embodied the contradiction of expansionist capitalism that prized wealth and an isolationist culture that valued nationalistic pride: Creoles were seen as necessary to the invigoration of the economy but were resented for socio- economic mobility and for their association with negative qualities of the tropics. This dynamic of attraction/ repulsion extended to species theories, where writers argued that miscegenation would result in degeneration or invigoration of the species." In both cases, as Young points out, the intended result was “a more efficient form of colonialism” (143). These tensions were readable in eighteenth-century narrative. Sypher claims: In the literature of the period, the Creole was characterized not only as the genial, spendthrift Creole of Cumberland's West Indian, but also as the coarse, over-bearing, licentious planter of Bage's Man as He Is, Jonathan Corncob, Captain Majoribanks' poem Slavery, and the satiric verses of “Timothy Touchstone." (88) Sypher notes that not just one but numerous stereotypes accommodated a range of anxieties about the plantocracy's relationship with the motherland. What often unites these differing images is their use of sentimental language to both warn of and resolve the threats creolization posed to the culture and economy. The abolitionist debates that gained public notice around the 1770s and throughout the century were rife with sentimental language, both for and against slavery." Cumberland's play rehearses these stereotypes, depicting the Creole character as both attractive and dangerous. Stockwell, a well-respected London merchant and Member of Parliament, has furtively married the daughter of a wealthy Jamaican plantation owner, and the product of their romanticDomesticating the Colonial Heart enterprise has been kept secret so as to ensure Belcour's inheritance of his grandfather's estate. Belcour's temperament is determined by temperature; he embodies the passionate and dangerous West Indies, often called, as Felicity Nussbaum reminds us, the torrid zones, as much for the heat as for the lascivious character ascribed to the region. The play opens with domestic and commercial concerns expressed in sentimental terms. Meeting for the first time, Stockwell prepares himself for the “affecting interview” (1.4.143) that is intended to be a test of Belcour's character; for in true sentimental mode, Belcour is made to undergo a trial before he is brought into the familial fold. Stockwell's name connotes a well-supplied and well-regulated economy; he is father and fatherland, both of which have worked industriously to secure their assets in the colonies. But his wish to own his Creole son is tempered by his business prudence: Stockwell. before I publicly reveal myself, I could wish to make some experiment of my son's disposition ... I think, I shall discover much more of this real character under the title of his merchant, than I should under that of his father. (1.1.81-86) Cumberland ties the business of patrimony to commerce. Stockwell, a merchant of multiple “ventures” and “concerns in foreign bottoms” (1.1.2, 6), engages to “enter on a course of lectures directly” that will show Belcour how to “govern with a temperate and restrained authority” his “good estate” (1.5.208, 203). Doubtless, it is Stockwell's most personal and domestic foreign affair. Indeed, Stockwell highlights the importance of geography to personal merits, and even though Belcour is not of African descent, his father suggests that Belcour's body is marked by geography: “Stock: was I to choose a pupil, it should be one of your complexion” (1.5.229-30). Thus theAdventures in Domesticity dangers creolization poses to the social body are emplotted into a narrative of sentimental patriarchal education. Just as planters had to send their raw sugar to England to be refined and exported back to the colonies, ready for consumption, so too does Stockwell bring Belcour from Jamaica to London in order to refine his feelings and prepare him for the public functions of marriage and of commerce. On that account, Belcour's trial begins: his unknown father will instruct him in how to conquer intemperate passion and render the West Indian suited to the English climate of brisk commercial trade. The Creole figure's position is in flux: he is at once plantation owner and overseer of colonial production, and also commodity fetish within an economy of colonial difference. As with the nineteenth-century "commodity racism" Anne McClintock describes, the cleaning up of Belcour's character demonstrates the complicity between the cult of domesticity and the fiction of a discrete and unified English identity (207- 209) Nations need maps to delineate the boundaries of their nationhood, and citizens who cross those borders require marks of identification. Like many social theorists of his time, Cumberland uses geography to explain social relations. In the following passage, Stockwell prepares the lovely young heiress, Charlotte, for her first encounter with Belcour. In his exhortation, he establishes the relation of the Creole to his parent country: Stockwell. You will not be over-strict, madam, in weighing Mr. Belcour's conduct to the minutest scruple; his manners, passions, and opinions, are not as yet assimilated to this climate; he comes amongst you a new character, an inhabitant of a new world, and both hospitality, as well as pity, recommend him to our indulgence. (5.3.140-45)Domesticating the Colonial Heart This socio-geography was supported by a growing body of natural history that claimed one's "conduct, manners, passions, and opinions” were determined by climate. As a Creole — genealogically English but culturally African/West Indian — Belcour swerves between the position of colonized and colonizer. Taking on the attributes of West Indian culture, Belcour embodies colonial difference that must be assimilated into the values of the dominant culture. In a discursive reversal of colonial history, the West Indian will explore, as Stockwell puts it, the “new world” of England." But unlike the historically bloody scenes of colonial encounters, the encounter with Charlotte, a virtuous Englishwoman and representative of England, will be one of "hospitality." Stockwell dictates the terms of social encounter in the language of discovery, a discursive move that domesticates exploration by transferring the scene of contact between colony and metropole to the domestic stage. Jamaica formed his “character"; England will recast it. Belcour's “manners, passions, and opinions" will yield to sentimental indulgence (their "hospitality” and “pity”) and effect his “assimilation,” for, culturally but not constitutionally African/West Indian, Belcour is capable of conversion. Thus the problems of colonial contact are embodied in the charming white Creole, Belcour, and are managed by his sentimental father. The lovely young heiress, Charlotte Rusport, further demonstrates that temperature determines temperament when she praises Belcour's generosity: eit 1 Charlotte. O blessed by the torrid zone for ever, whose rapid vegetation quickens nature into such benignity! These latitudes are made for politics and philosophy; friendship has no root in this soil. (61)Adventures in Domesticity Belcour is aware of the dangers of too much heart, for having grown “accustomed to a land of slaves” (1.5.178-79), he owns: “my passions are my masters; they take me where they will, and oftentimes they leave to reason and to virtue nothing but my wishes and my sighs" (1.5.212-15). Cumberland uses the language of slavery to suggest that geography has the power to invert a social hierarchy. A slave owner, Belcour possesses and masters the bodies of slaves, but creolization threatens to enslave the master with unruly passion. Travel could take one down the path of ill-regulated passions just as easily as it could lead to domestic virtue. Unsurprisingly, when Stockwell, the patriarch in The West Indian, asks if Mr. Belcour, the eponymous hero, has “brought over a collection of wild beasts” (1.2.93-94), we discover that it is not the “two green monkies, a pair of grey parrots, a Jamaica sow and pigs, and a Mangrove dog" (1.2.96-97), but Belcour himself, who is "wild ... as the manner of his country is” (1.4.150-51). Indeed, the dark implication of miscegenation or perhaps even rape colors Belcour's “strong animal spirits” (3.5.269). When Belcour claims that the virtuous Louisa "put my blood in a flame" (4.3.76-77), his desire alarms Stockwell, for passion nurtured by the heat of the tropics menaces the cool narrative of domestic English womanhood. Indeed, Stockwell delays revealing his paternity in order to test his son's disposition, which will be gauged in relation to his sexual commerce with women. Stockwell cautions Belcour: “When this lady has confirm'd your pardon, I shall hold you deserving of my confidence” (5.4.158-59). Louisa is the ideal testing ground: for while she has “beauty enough indeed to inflame your desires, but she has honour, innocence and simplicity to awe the most licentious passion” (4.10.509-10). Louisa's virtue has been tried, defended, and proven throughout the play. Moreover, as Captain Dudley's daughter, she is a child of the British navy, the offspring of colonial power, and therefore an ideal representative andDomesticating the Colonial Heart 89 guardian of colonial ideology. The virtuous Louisa Dudley's acceptance of Belcour as husband is necessary to the resolution of the play, and it is because of Belcour's romantic choice that Stockwell will acknowledge his son. In the last scene, Stockwell says: "your election of this excellent young lady makes me glory in acknowledging you to be my son” (5.8.440- 41). So crucial is the role of sexual behavior, that Stockwell tells Louisa : "his love for you and virtue is the same” (5.6.297). Well-regulated sexuality is the panacea for the anxieties raised during the play, as Stockwell's words of relief demonstrate: "Then I am happy: all my doubts, my cares are over, and I may own him for my son" (5.6.293-94). Belcour himself is aware that he must adopt a cooler temperament in order to be acknowledged as a true Englishman and senses that a good marriage would ensure Stockwell's good graces: “Stockwell indeed wants me to marry, but till I can get this bewitching girl, this incognita, out of my head, I can never think of any other woman” (3.1.48- 50). Belcour's too-passionate pursuit of Louisa Dudley puts him in trouble's way. Set upon by Mr. and Mrs. Fulmer, a pair of grifters masquerading as married landlords, Belcour reveals that it is not only in temperament, but in name, that he is out of step with England. Mrs. Fulmer asks his name, and the following exchange ensues: Belcour. Upon my soul, I can't tell you my name. Mrs. Fulmer. Not tell me! Why so? Belcour. Because I don't know what it is myself; as yet I have no name. Mrs. Fulmer. No name! Belcour. None; a friend, indeed, lent me his; but he forbade me to use it on any unworthy occasion. (2.5.250-56)90 Adventures in Domesticity Belcour's lack of an identity could be read as metaphor for the colonized's lack of subjective power. The practice of renaming Africans upon their arrival in American and Caribbean colonies as slaves was a form of baptism that would ostensibly render them convertible to Christianity. It also established social hierarchies and disrupted identification of family members. Naming, and its physical symbolic equivalent – branding – effected what Orlando Patterson has called “social death."20 Not yet named — or, as Stockwell says, “owned” as legitimate son — Belcour inhabits a liminal position, symbolic of his status as a Creole. As a Creole, he represents the threatening figure of an African and/or West Indian enculturated Englishman. He is on some levels identified with Africans and West Indians (stereotyped as lascivious and slothful), though he is unquestionably a slaveowner. This cultural baggage threatens to lower his hierarchical position on the social ladder of patriarchal English culture, but he is not inherently incapable of social mobility. In connecting legitimation to naming, Belcour is aware that acceptance into the patrilineage is contingent upon a particular code of conduct. The “occasion” is Belcour's pursuit of Louisa, and what is “unworthy” is his manner of relating to the virtuous Englishwoman. As a Jamaican-born Englishman, his passions “master” him, and though he is a slave-plantation owner, the creolization of the Englishman portends a potentially disturbing inversion of the “natural” social hierarchy. He is no longer master of himself when his actions are slave to his Creole temperament. Belcour's eager attention frightens Louisa, who tells her brother, Charles, that she was “beset in the strangest manner" (2.4.156-57): “I cannot say he was absolutely rude to me, but he was very importunate to speak to me, and once or twice attempted to lift up my hat: he followed me to the corner of the street, and there I gave him the slip” (2.4.159-62).Domesticating the Colonial Heart Belcour's attempt to accost Louisa in the street flies in the face of traditional modes of introduction and poses the threat of an inappropriate correspondence. His attempt to lift her hat – to unveil her face, to denude her beauty publicly — has sexual overtones that, coupled with the force of his encounter, suggest that he is a character whose passions pose a physical danger to virtuous ladies. Cumberland intends such scenes to be morally instructive, enlisting feeling in the service of inculcating virtue, but the didactic qualities of the play are grounded in questions of race. Here, sentiment signals excess: Belcour's responses are too sensate, too bodily or suggestive, qualities often associated with the Creole figure. Thus, for the Creole planter whose position in the English (social) economy is both needed and troublesome, sensibility was depicted as a potentially dangerous trait that must be managed. Before learning of Belcour's untoward behavior toward his sister, Charles describes Belcour as a "young West Indian, rich, and with a warmth of heart peculiar to his climate" (3.7.496-97). And it is that very warmth of heart that frightens Louisa. When the two finally meet, Louisa tries to escape Belcour's excessive profession of love: “You terrify me; your impetuous temper frightens me” (4.3.76-77). The social implication of Belcour's “temper” makes their exchange both a sexual and a colonial encounter. In narrating the scene, Belcour utilizes colonial metaphors, and compares Jamaican sexual relations to those in England: If every handsome girl I meet in this town is to lead me such a wild-goose chace, I had better have stayed in the torrid zone. I shall be wasted to the size of a sugar-cane. What shall I do? give the chace up? Hang it, that's cowardly Shall I, a true-born son of Phoebus, suffer this little nimble-footed Daphne to escape me?" (2.5.181-87)Adventures in Domesticity Belcour longs for the robust climate of Jamaica, one that yields the fruits of romantic labor. The passage evokes depictions of West Indians as lascivious and suggests that romantic commerce between planters and Englishwomen violated the codes of domestic virtue. Cumberland invokes the familiar stereotype of the lascivious Creole when he has Belcour plead the influence of the West Indies to explain his actions. Stockwell accuses Belcour of being “slave of every face you meet” (3.1.88) in response to his son's exorbitant expressions of love. Belcour rails against the forces of nature, and the following exchange ensues: Stockwell. Hey-day! what has turned you thus on a sudden? Belcour. A woman: one that can turn, and overturn me and my tottering resolutions every way she will. Oh, sir, if this is folly in me, you must rail at nature: you must chide the sun, that was vertical at my birth, and would not wink upon my nakedness, but swaddled me in the broadest, hottest glare of his meridian beams. Stockwell. Mere rhapsody; mere childish rhapsody: the libertine's familiar plea — Nature made us, 'tis true, but we are the responsible creators of our own faults and follies. (3.1.77- 86) Stockwell accepts Belcour's geography of morality. But by equating Creole temperament with libertinage, he suggests that Belcour's sexual transgressions are not the result of an inescapable biology, but an excuse for concupiscence. His ability to be cultivated out of his cultural context separates Belcour from the slaves he owns and from the overseers andDomesticating the Colonial Heart Creoles of Caribbean plantations guilty of miscegenation and rape. But while Stockwell asserts that Belcour is a “responsible creator," their exchange summons those sexual threats that the Caribbean poses to the English social body. Belcour's mistaking Louisa for a wanton woman, and his subsequent attempt on her virtue, symbolize the threat to traditional morality and culture that resulted from the constant negotiation of commerce between England and her colonies. Cumberland infantizes Belcour's untempered sexuality (“mere childish rhapsody"), suggesting that sexual commerce requires governance, and that the development of domestic sexuality must be overseen by the benevolent patriarch. The scene closes with Stockwell's lament: “O Nature, what it is to be a father! Just such a thoughtless headlong thing was I when I beguiled his mother into love” (3.1.123-25). Belcour must replicate his father's mating rituals, and avoid turning domestic rituals of courtship into the "wild adventure” his father fears it has become (3.1.122-23). Stockwell's recognition of similarity is also a resignation; his heir was born of beguilement and secrecy, and English commerce with the colonies is represented as necessarily transgressive. This necessary transgression is what Young sees at the heart of "colonial desire,” and at the heart of the desire for a fixed and discrete identity: “Perhaps the fixity of identity for which Englishness developed such a reputation arose because it was in fact continually being contested, and was rather designed to mask its uncertainty, its sense of being estranged from itself, sick with desire for the other” (2). These are the just the sorts of "uncertain crossing[s] and invasion[s] of identity" that Cumberland's characters enact in pursuit of their fiction of domesticity. Throughout the play, commerce and sexuality are connected through the various marriages. The Fulmers are itinerant grifters who embody a threat to domestic stability. They are the consummate players whose masquerading94 Adventures in Domesticity threatens to upend the social stability and familial relations of the other characters in the play. It is Mrs. Fulmer who tells Belcour that Louisa is a strumpet and coaxes him into his lewd proposition. When the two are caught, Fulmer attempts to exculpate himself by accusing Mrs. Fulmer of orchestrating the masquerade: “I always condemned the plot as a very foolish plot, but it was a child of Mrs. Fulmer's brain, and she would not be put out of conceit with it” (88). The mother of illegitimacy, Mrs. Fulmer births plots that threaten to corrupt legitimate family ties and challenge codes of honor and virtue. Here, for example, she rages against their lack of success and scolds her faux-husband for “inveigling" her from Bologne: You had then a thousand ingenious devices to repair your fortune; and this, your native country, was to be the scene of your performances: fool that I was, to be inveigled into it by you: but, thank Heaven, our partnership is revocable; I am not your wedded wife, praised be my stars! for what have we got, whom have we gull’d but ourselves. (2.1.8-14) Illegitimacy of character and commerce are mirrored by illegitimacy of the family tie. If their schemes rely upon a fiction of character – pretending to be married, cajoling Belcour into believing that Louisa is a wanton woman, and that she and father are lovers rather than relatives - Mrs. Fulmer privately acknowledges that it is she, and not Belcour, who has no name, no place in society. Ironically, then, the woman whose profession entails falsifying the identity of others knows exactly who she is. The corrupt couple's marriage is a masquerade: they wear the mask of legitimacy, but underneath, they are the face of immorality. On the other hand, Belcour supposes himself to be illegitimate, since his mother pretended to have adopted him in order to avoid her father's disapprovalDomesticating the Colonial Heart over a secret marriage. Stockwell's marriage is the inverse of the Fulmers' — secretly legitimate though publicly undeclared. Belcour's legitimacy is thus privately underwritten by licit patriarchy and the respectable merchant class. The virtuous Louisa and her brother are validated when their uncle's will reveals them to be rightful heirs to a vast estate, providing social and financial status to support their inherent worth. Within this framework, Belcour must prove the worth of his character and gain his public legitimacy by making the right marriage choice. But Belcour's Creole character ever threatens to prevent the necessary marriage to Louisa. Belcour is duped by the Fulmers into believing Louisa to be a wanton woman, and, as we shall see, Cumberland suggests that his subsequent attempt on her virtue is a result of the influence of race and plantation culture. On bended knee, Belcour restrains his “dear, tormenting, tantalizing girl” (4.3.129) and offers an illicit proposition: In a few words, then, and in plain honesty, I must tell you, so entirely am I captivated with you, that had you but been such as it would have become me to have called my wife, I had been happy in knowing you by that name; as it is, you are welcome to partake my fortune, give me in return your person, give me pleasure, give me love; free, disencumber'd, anti-matrimonial love. (4.3.121-27) Louisa repulses him, “Stand off, and let me never see you no more” (4.3.128), and calls to her brother for protection: “Unhand me, sir: O Charles! protect me, rescue me, redress me” (4.3.132-33). Charles accuses Belcour of villainy and threatens swordplay to avenge "this fatal stab to our domestic peace” (4.4.145). Louisa's virtue becomes, as it usually does96 Adventures in Domesticity in sentimental comedy, the symbolic battleground over which the two men will negotiate the bride-property. But the contest over the female terrain also becomes a question of colonial geography. Belcour returns to Stockwell's house, and “throws himself upon a Sofa" (4.10.421-22) in exasperation: “O my curst tropical constitution! Would to Heaven I had been dropt upon the snows of Lapland, and never felt the blessed influence of the sun, so I had never burnt with these inflammatory passions!” (4.10.422-25). The physical/ ethical effects of geography, so popular a topic among natural historians, threaten to contaminate the blood and temper not only of Africans and West Indian blacks, but of white Creoles as well. Belcour's Creole character draws both approbation and opprobrium. Raised under the heat of the West Indian sun, he is praised for his kindness, a true “West Indian, rich, and with a warmth of heart peculiar to his climate” (3.6.496-97), but also condemned for being "an idle, dissipated, unthinking fellow .. . in short, ... a West Indian” (3.7.464-66). The stereotype of the languid West Indian lacking fortitude is portrayed as economically dangerous, for in subordinating prudence to passion, Belcour leaves himself open to the Fulmers' schemes. Mrs. Fulmer speculates that his Jamaican temperament will vitiate his judgement. Self-congratulatory, she sizes up Belcour: “Who found out his name, fortune, connection; that he was a West-Indian, fresh landed, and full of cash; a gull to our heart's content; a hot-brained, head-long spark, that would run into our trap” (3.2.134-37). Belcour's relationship to the Fulmers and to Stockwell stands in for the relationship of the colonies to the metropole and suggests that the West Indies require England's guiding hand, that, as Charlotte declares, England is “made for politics and philosophy” (61), and the colonies are for leisure and sensuality. Belcour's lament continues:Domesticating the Colonial Heart 97 Stockwell. You seem disordered, Mr. Belcour! Belcour. Disorder'd, sir! Why did I ever quit the soil in which I grew? what evil planet drew me from that warm sunny region, where naked nature walks without disguise, into this cold, contriving, artificial country? (4.10.426-30) Belcour's sexual skullduggery is understood in relation to contemporary race theories, and the implicit suggestion is that the lasciviousness of black culture has threatened to contaminate the "domestic peace” of England by inducing Creole men to assault its virtuous women. The test of Belcour's sexual temperament inherently implies an eighteenth-century concern with the measure of labor practices: as I will elaborate in my next two chapters, sexuality was tied to labor and sexual choice determined property lines. Sexuality was thus central to legal and social debates. Stereotypes of the African, black West Indian, and white Creole as indolent and lusty permeated travel narratives, natural histories, and fictive accounts that included tropical figures in their list of characters. The characterization of the West Indian or African as especially concupiscent was a familiar one that served to create a pornogeography, if you will, a sexual geography that was used to map out colonial difference. Nussbaum notes that the widespread connection between national or cultural type and sexual geography underpinned colonial difference: Though Montesquieu, Hume, Millar, Ferguson, and others map the world somewhat variously, each connects climate and sexual desire to define a temperate, civilized Europe that possesses the sexual constraints necessary to engage in the work-discipline productive of political liberty and civic virtue, in marked98 Adventures in Domesticity contrast to the libidinous and indolent torrid zones. (10) And Anne McClintock claims that “Africa and the Americas had become what can be called a porno-tropics for the European imagination — a fantastic magic lantern of the mind onto which Europe projected its forbidden sexual desires and fears." We can read Stockwell's concern to contain Belcour's sexuality as a synecdoche for England's concern over the sexual and labor practices of the colonies. In Cumberland's play, sensibility converts the dangerous sexuality of the West Indies into an intellectual and business prowess, one tempered by emotions that signal virtue and that are guarded by domestic English womanhood. By posing the problem as a sentimental one, as the problem of refining a basically good hearted man into a "reformed, ... rational admirer” (5.5.192), Cumberland transfers the business of colonial sexuality into the realm of domesticity, one ruled by virtuous women. Louisa is an adept guardian of domestic virtue who has the power to refine the raw passions of the Creole. Belcour tells Louisa she has "conquered” him, that he has "no inclination to rebel” (5.5.196-97). No longer slave to unsanctioned passions, he will be ruled by Louisa's virtue: “I know I am not worthy your regard; I know I'm tainted with a thousand faults, sick of a thousand follies; but there's a healing virtue in your eyes that makes recovery certain; I cannot be a villain in your arms” (5.5.205-208). Belcour's taint is removed when his "soul is conquered with (Louisa's] virtues” (5.5.223). By transporting colonial anxiety over sexual and economic commerce with the West Indies into the marriage arena, Cumberland propounds the fiction of an apolitical domestic realm. Like plantation owners who "domesticated” slaves in order to render them suited to labor, Cumberland attempts to domesticate sexual and colonial adventures in order to render them suitable forDomesticating the Colonial Heart entertainment. His play exemplifies the literary shift from homely adventures that valued colonial difference to homely adventures that prized assimilation of colonial difference into a bourgeois ideal. Their marriage concludes the play in full sentimental mode. Stockwell reveals his paternity after Belcour promises Louisa marriage: "your election of this excellent young lady makes me glory in acknowledging you to be my son” (5.8. 440-41). Belcour exults under the knowledge of his true lineage, and declares that his "heart is softened for the affecting discovery, and nature fits me to receive his blessing” (5.8.420-22). If Belcour's “heart is softened,” Stockwell's is “beaming with benevolence,” and we are assured of Belcour's conversion, for he now speaks the same language used by his father at the beginning of the play. Stockwell longed for the “sensible relief” (1.1.16) of owning his son, and at the close of the play, Belcour is “sensibly imprest with gratitude for such extraordinary dispensations.” Belcour unites sentimental and commercial language: his father's affections are "dispensations” that prompt him to “glory in the father I have gained" (5.8.442-44). Thus is the power of sentimental domesticity: it contains outside threats and normalizes men and women into subjects willing to be governed by virtue. Indeed, the last word of the play is obey. Belcour enlists Louisa's domesticating powers in the service of his continued conversion: “I beseech you, amiable Louisa, for the time to come, whenever you perceive me deviating into error or offence, bring only to my mind the Providence of this night, and I will turn to reason, and obey” (5.8.444-47). The transference of the language of insurrection to the realm of sentiment is a forceful act of containment during a time when the threat of revolution loomed large. From the rebellious American colonies to the West Indian colonies, where white planters were often outnumbered by blacks and mulattos by as much as ten to one, writing from and about the Caribbean100 Adventures in Domesticity vocalized fears about insurrection. Translating the threat of insurrection into the sentimentalized discourse of domestic love leaves the audience with romantic feelings rather than fear. Cumberland's plot addresses this highly visible concern: the relationship between sexuality and property in the West Indian plantocracy, where domesticity becomes the decoy for the negotiation of colonial difference. Cumberland's use of sentimentality to manage the threat of colonial travel was a common move in eighteenth- century fiction. The language of sentimentality, so popular with travel writers, fiction writers, and natural historians, argued (both overtly and implicitly) that the domestic English home was a superior place that required protection from external assault. During the time of The West Indian's popularity, colonial difference was represented as a threat to the English rural home and to female virtue in particular. No longer used to propel an adventure narrative, colonial difference was now employed as a negative model to advocate rural domestic virtue. We shall see in the next chapter that late-eighteenth-century women travel writers and poets translated colonialism's socioeconomic concerns into sentimental, domestic narratives. We have seen in The West Indian that narratives of adventure and domesticity converge. As in the story of Maria Williams (see Introduction), Belcour's fictional contemporary, domesticity is now the suitable kind of adventure for colonial English subjects. But it is also the kind of adventure appropriate to the assimilation of the Creole character into the patriarchal English social order. Thus does Cumberland's play make visible the important relation between domestic concerns and colonial concerns. Colonial concerns — questions of nationality, domestic and sexual relations, economy -- were also domestic concerns. It is important to foreground this relationship in order to make room for the fluidity of ideas traded between colony and metropole. If a colonial analysis ofDomesticating the Colonial Heart 101 sentimentality can help us to appreciate the span of its generic reaches and political aims, it can also help us attempt a criticism that accounts for the fluidity between domestic and public realms. Such a criticism would move us toward a more complex understanding of the subtle ways gender and race participated in the many narratives of British identities. Notes See Peter Freyer's Staying Power: The History of Black People in Britian (London: Pluto Press, 1984) and Wylie Sypher's Guinea's Captive Kings: British Anti-Slavery Literature of the XVIIIth Century (New York: Octagon Books, 1969) for discussions about the social position and the literary representation of West Indian planters. See Richard Dirks's Richard Cumberland (Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1976), 30-43 for a reading of The West Indian as “a play [that] combines two highly sentimental tales” (30). One recent exception is Maaja Stewart's article, “Inexhaustible Generosity: The Fictions of Eighteenth-Century British Imperialism in Richard Cumberland's The West Indian," which looks at the correspondence between imperial texts and courtship narratives in the context of imperial violence. As an enormous body of scholarship has demonstrated, the term race as we now use it came into being largely through the nineteenth-century discourses of scientific racism that developed from eighteenth-century natural historians such as Carl Linneaus, Edward Long, Bryan Edwards, and Thomas Jefferson, who began to codify and taxonomize what we have come to call race. For excellent discussions about social history and the construction of race, see Reginold Horseman, Race and Manifest Destiny (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981), chapter 3, “Science and Inequality,” and chapter 4, “Racial Anglo-Saxonism in England”; Winthrop Jordan,102 Adventures in Domesticity White Over Black: American Attitudes Toward the Negro, 1550-1812 (New York: Norton, 1977), especially chapter 3; Anthony Appiah and Amy Gutman, Color Conscious: The Political Morality of Race (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996), section 2, “Race, Culture, Identity: Misunderstood Connections"; Robert Young, Colonial Desire: Hybridity in Theory, Culture and Race (New York: Routledge, 1995); and Anne McClintock, Imperial Leather: Race, Gender, and Sexuality in the Colonial Context (New York: Routledge, 1995), to name only a few. Long was a relative by marriage of William Beckford the Elder who, as a West Indian sugar plantocrat and commodities trader, became one of the richest men in London. Beckford was widely derided for what was viewed as crass West Indian habits; even Samuel Johnson was said to have asked where Beckford "learn[ed] English” (Sypher 86-87). Like Long, Beckford published accounts of Jamaica: “Remarks upon the situation of negroes in Jamaica, impartially made from a local experience of nearly thirteen years in that island, by W. Beckford" (London: printed for T. and J. Egerton, 1788). He wrote another similar account two years later, which began “A descriptive account of the island of Jamaica . . ." and was published in two volumes. For commentary on Beckford and the West India lobby, see Freyer, Staying Power, 44-50. For a discussion of the social impact of late-eighteenth- century slavery debates, especially the famous Somerset case, see Gretchen Gerzina's Black London: Life before Emancipation (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1995), especially chapter 4, “Sharp and Mansfield: Slavery in the Courts”; Edward Scobie's Black Britannia: A History of Blacks in Britain (Chicago: Johnson Publishing Company, 1972), especially chapter 5, “The Law Takes No Notice ofDomesticating the Colonial Heart 103 Negroes””; Reconstructing the Black Past: Blacks in Britain 1780–1830 (Portland, OR: Frank Cass, 1996), by Norma Meyers. Markman Ellis touches on the Somerset case within the context of his analysis of the relation between sentimentality and the slavery debates of the late eighteenth century. See his chapters “Delight in Misery: Sentimentalism, Amelioration and Slavery,” and “The House of Bondage': Sentimentalism and the Problem of Slavery” in The Politics of Sensibility (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996). See Young's Colonial Desire, chapter 1, “Hybridity and Diaspora,” where he traces the evolution of scientific racism (in part) through language. Linking the relation between hybridized language and sex, Young notes that “both produced what were regarded as 'hybrid' forms (creole, pidgin and miscegenated children), which were seen to embody threatening forms of perversion and degeneration and became the basis for endless metaphoric extension in the racial discourse of social commentary” (5). © In the first chapter of Colonial Desire, Young addresses the fiction of a fixed English identity and suggests that obsession over uncertainty of identity was responsible for multiple narratives of "colonial desire” (2-3). For further discussion of the connection between sexual and economic discourses, see chapter 6, “White Power, White Desire: The Political Economy of Miscegenation.” Young addresses Long's History, in particular, on pp. 150-52. Felicity Nussbaum's work in Torrid Zones: Maternity, Sexuality, and Empire in Eighteenth-Century English Narratives (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1995) demonstrates an important connection between the regulation of domestic English sexuality and the codification of racial identity: “The domestic virtue demanded of Englishwomen104 Adventures in Domesticity ensured the legitimacy of family and property, of course, but regulating sexuality in the eighteenth century (as now) also was often an attempt to define and legislate racial purity through such policies as natal alienation and antimiscegenation laws" (2) For the most extensive treatment of the history and relation between sexuality and sensibility, see Jean Hagstrom's Sex and Sensibility: Ideal and Erotic Love from Milton to Mozart (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980). 9 Janet Todd, Sensibility: An Introduction (New York: Methuen, 1986), 9. In The Politics of Sensibility, Ellis also agrees that the terins were often interchangeable: “The terms 'sensibility' and 'sentimental' denote a complex field of meanings and connotations in the late eighteenth century, overlapping and coinciding to such an extent as to offer no obvious distinction” (7). He claims that the terms often merged through a set of intersecting concerns that include moral philosophy, religious, political economy, science, history of sexuality, etc. (8). 10 Wendy Motooka, in the Age of Reasons (New York: Routledge, 1998), reminds us of generic fluidity: “In the eighteenth century, ... literature, moral philosophy and the 'science of man' had not yet solidified into distinct disciplines that they have since become. What linked them was their sentimentalism, their attempt to discover natural order in human societies through the empirical study of moral knowledge” (28). 11 Stephen Cox, in “Sensibility as Argument,” in Sensibility in Transformation, ed. Syndy McMillen Conger (Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1990), notes the power of sentimentality to shape the individual: “as a source ofDomesticating the Colonial Heart 105 education, as a means of imputing value and interest to the individual selves that participate in moral and political systems, it was a remarkable success” (Cox 80). But while sentimental responses were portrayed as individual (subjective) and natural, they often served to reinforce social hierarchies built on colonial and patriarchal ideologies. 12 See, for example, Moira Ferguson's Subject to Others: British Women Writers and Colonial Slavery, 1670-1834 (New York: Routledge, 1992). 1 In Robert Norris's Memoirs of the Reign of Bossa Ahadee, King of Dahomey (1789); (London: Frank Cass and Company, 1968) from which Sypher claims Cumberland “[d]rew his ammunition,” Norris militates against the sentimental nature of abolitionist tracts, which "inflame the passions, and prejudice the minds of the community, by various publications, containing the most gross misstatements of facts, and misrepresentation of characters” (169). (Since the earliest date of composition of Norris' memoir is 1773, the text could not have influenced the composition of The West Indian, which was performed first in 1771.) He wishes to avoid that which will “excite compassion, and rouze indignation” (169), in short, to eschew "every consideration of feeling” in order to allow for reasonable reflection (183-84). Just as both Jacobin and anti-Jacobin writers embraced and shunned sentimentality depending upon their political posture, colonial writers sometimes adopted sentiment as a rhetorical tool, and alternatively denounced it as a way of undercutting the opposing political camp. Janet Todd describes the various political uses of sentimentalism during the time of the French Revolution: “The Anti-Jacobin Review, the new organ of conservative opinion, worked to bind sensibility to radicalism, or ‘Jacobinism' as it insisted on calling any reformist view, and it blamed both for106 Adventures in Domesticity the unrest it feared was spreading in England. The radicals, on their side, were just as eager as the conservatives to align sensibility with their opponents, and they attacked as sentimental the reactionary nostalgia and emotional callousness they saw promoted in the Anti-Jacobin. Clearly neither side wished to be left in possession of a now unfashionable sensibility, but neither side wanted entirely to abandon the power of emotive, sentimental language” (Sensibility 130). For a detailed analysis of the transformation sensibility underwent during the Revolutionary era, see Chris Jones' Radical Sensibility: Literature and ideas in the 1790s (1993). Jordon, in White Over Black, notes that the political function of benevolence (as an instance of sentimentality) carried a variable amount of authority: “Most philosophers hoped that their findings would comport with the dictates of benevolence, but the misery of the slave could never be allowed to dictate God's creation. It would be pleasant if the world were both happy and tidy, but there was no question as to which was the preferable condition if the two should happen to conflict” (483). Politically speaking, proslavery apologists would not admit that a slave's access to sentimental virtue was cause for leveling social hierarchies. The realm of feeling, according to philosophers like David Hume, may allow people to distinguish between virtue and vice, but the sociopolitical ramifications of such emotional or moral equality could only go so far. The trope of the benevolent patriarch, of course, has a long literary history. For an interesting discussion of the "paradigm shift from aristocratic to bourgeois ideology” that uses what J. Douglas Canfield calls “the trope of the benevolent fratriarch” in Shadwell's The Lancashire Witches see “Shifting Tropes of Ideology in English Serious Drama, Late Stuart to Early Georgian,” in Cultural Readings of Restoration and Eighteenth-Century English Theater (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1995).Domesticating the Colonial Heart 107 While Sypher's example is from a nineteenth-century novel, resentment toward newly rich plantation owners was visible by the second half of the eighteenth century. See Sypher's Guinea's Captive Kings and also his article, “The West Indian as a Character in the Eighteenth Century,” Studies in Philology 36 (1939): 503–20. © This dynamic was central to the development of scientific racism. Young notes: “Attraction and repugnance between the races became a key issue in the debate about racial difference; it was clearly linked to sexuality, a factor that was not lost upon Darwin” (15). " In Imperial Eyes (New York: Routledge, 1992), Mary Louise Pratt connects sensibility to travel writing, and claims that sentimental travel writing emerged, at least in part, out of the abolitionist movement (86). While it is a commonplace to claim that the abolition movement enlisted sentimentality to argue its cause, Pratt is right to remark on the less noted connection between travel writing and colonialist fiction's use of sentimentality beginning in the mid eighteenth century. 18 See Nussbaum, Torrid Zones, who thoroughly researches the influence geography had on the way the English imagined the tropics and Africa in relation to England. 19 The West Indian is indeed a "new character” in the eighteenth century; second- and third-generation plantation owners were often raised in the Caribbean and didn't visit England until their school or marriage years. Public debate over the social role of the Creole resulted in the appearance of this “new character” in an abundance of eighteenth-century fiction.108 Adventures in Domesticity 20 Orlando Patterson discusses naming in chapter 2, “Authority, Alienation, and Social Death” in Slavery and Social Death: A Comparative Study (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982). 21 Ubiquitous and numerous tracts asserted that the physical constitution of Africans enabled them to work. In America, tracts like Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia (a natural history written in response to le Comte de Buffon's claim that America's climate was insalubrious to agriculture and to healthy quadrupeds) contrasted Africans with Native Americans, who were said to be ill-suited to labor, as were Europeans, who were supposed to be better suited to supervision and activities of the mind. 22 McClintock, Imperial Leather, 22. Christopher Miller's Blank Darkness is built on this thesis of projection of European desires/fears onto the supposed blank slate of Africa, a thesis that follows from Edward Said's Orientalism.Chapter 3 Domesticating the Colony: Dramatizing Domesticity in Women's Travel Writing When Anna Maria Falconbridge landed in Freetown, Sierra Leone, in 1791, it was as the wife of Alexander Falconbridge, an agent of the Sierra Leone Company, an abolitionist enterprise established to repatriate free English blacks and to capitalize on commerce with West Africa. The colony was already populated by over a thousand former American slaves who had been freed after fighting on the side of England during the War of Independence, but many of these settlers and the other English had been driven from their homes after King Jemmy, a local ruler, burned the village in a dispute with English agents over rent money. In her Narrative of Two Voyages to the River Sierra Leone in the Years 1791-1792, Falconbridge tells us that her husband's first duty was to corral black and white settlers connected with the Company who had scattered across the countryside after King Jemmy's assault on the village. She went with him and was shocked by what she saw, particularly when the spectacle included her own countrywomen, ex-prostitutes who “were intoxicated with liquor, then inveigled on board of a ship, and married to Black men, whom they had never seen before” (65):110 Adventures in Domesticity I never did, and God grant I never may again, witness so much misery as I was forced to be a spectator of Here: Among the outcasts were seven of our country women, decrepid with disease, and so disgusted with filth and dirt, that I should never have supposed they were born white; add to this, almost naked from head to foot; in short, their appearance was such as I think would extort compassion from the most callous heart; but I declare they seemed insensible to shame, or the wretchedness of the situation themselves; I begged they would get washed, and gave them what cloaths I could conveniently spare. (64) This scene is, in various ways, emblematic of the mutable status of the white woman in late-eighteenth-century colonial discourse. One middle-class white Englishwoman, just arrived from the metropolitan center, is moralizing witness to the degradation of lower-class colonial white women. Diseased, filthy, and naked, these shameless outcasts are insensible to the disturbing appearance they make. Their lack of shame at their naked, darkened bodies, is a clear indication that they have “gone native.” Falconbridge's attempt to wash and clothe them reveals a desire not only to undo a particular undesirable effect of colonialization but also a need to drape her text in the kind of modest sensibility appropriate to the recounting of so bodily a tale. Indeed, the in-between status of these women settlers — visually and socially marked as other but constitutionally English — recalls the difficulty writers had in determining English and Creole identity in the West Indies several decades earlier. Like the in-between characters we have seen in the first two chapters (Captain Singleton's naked and darkened Englishman in Africa and the hero of The WestDomesticating the Colony 111 Indian), these women are English in body but African in culture, and therefore present a problem of identification. Falconbridge's racialized reportage of the women and the extremity of her shock at their hybridized appearance perhaps unwittingly reveal England's obsession with racial mixing. Let's take another, closer look at this passage, focusing now on how her horror at prostitution varied depending upon the race of the women's sexual partners: the women were mostly of that description of persons who walk the streets of London, and support themselves by the earnings of prostitution; ... men were employed to collect and conduce them to Wapping, where they were intoxicated with liquor, then inveigled on board of a ship, and married to Black men, whom they had never seen before; ... “Thus,” in her [one of the prostitutes] own words, “to the disgrace of my mother country, upwards of one hundred unfortunate women, were seduced from England to practice their iniquities more brutishly in this horrid country.” (65-66) Falconbridge's wish to launder the outer markings that suggest race difference is a desire to cleanse them of the crimes related to their immigration: prostitution and interracial sexual activity. The traffic in cross-continental sex workers is described as a spectacle of sexual relations narrated in terms of class and race that lays bare the ways in which colonialism organized women's bodies as sexualized sites productive of more than just colonial subjects. In England, the prostitute served both as a site onto which excesses could be displaced and as a threat to the generative forces of bourgeois capital.? In the colony, the prostitute not only condensed the myth of exotic sexuality, but also discursively united, through the trope112 Adventures in Domesticity of the body, “decrepid with disease” (64), a trade in white women's bodies and African slave bodies. The trope of disease is, of course, a foundational metaphor for third-wave American feminism. Gilbert and Gubar's groundbreaking Madwoman in the Attic analyzed the body of the woman writer as a diseased danger to patriarchal values. Numerous other scholars have worked on the ways in which woman's body functions as a trope for social or national concerns. Mary Douglas's Purity and Danger has demonstrated how tropes of the pure or sullied body help explain social and moral rules; Mary Poovey analyzed disease as a metaphor for the social ills of pauperism and Victorian tensions with Irish Catholicism; Judith Butler theorized the ways in which the gendered and sexed body represents the socially hegemonic; and postcolonial scholars, like R. Radhakrishnan and Partha Chatterjee, have analyzed the relation between the female body and images of the nation- state.' Thus there is a long critical history of the many ways that social danger and disease are played out as a series of feminine, corporeal metaphors. But the trope of disease takes on a new form when we consider it in a colonial context. By the end of the eighteenth century, the powerful image of the diseased woman was a paradigm for the social ills of empire." As I will demonstrate later in this chapter, debates over slavery and colonial trade often used the language of disease and infection to articulate the dangers of miscegenation and creolization to English wealth and virtue. Eighteenth- century English literature also reveals a widespread fear that sexual, physical, and social infection would be imported from West Indian and African colonies along with other colonial goods. We have seen in the previous chapter that fiction writers and social theorists were preoccupied with the dangers of cultural mixing and miscegenation. Richard Cumberland's West Indian character embodied this fear that colonial cultural mixing would arrive at the shores of England and wreak havocDomesticating the Colony 113 on traditional social values and customs. As I argued in chapter 2 and will further demonstrate here, such concerns equated female virtue with national virtue, and thereby feminized the fight against such colonial dangers as miscegenation and cultural mixing. The larger aim of this chapter is to delineate the ways women travel writers dramatized domesticity as a means of negotiating the complex role of gender within a colonial contextº Travel writing politicized domesticity. Women travelers readily took up the business of sexuality, and drew from the rhetoric of travel and exploration, typically a male genre. But unlike travelogues written by men, women's narratives opened the domestic to exploration in a way that challenged stereotypes of women that had become fundamental to empire. Women travel writers often engaged in a critical ambivalence toward the gendered premises of imperialism by manipulating conventions of writing about colonialism. In this and other ways, women's writing about colonialism differed rhetorically from male-authored narratives, but both male and female travel writers were interested in the domestic economy of colonialism. This interest suggests that home was not a uniquely English space and that the domestic (in its multiple meanings) was open to exploration. The very fact of colonialism meant that home was transportable; home could be both here and there. Moreover, the domesticating impulse of natural history attempted to render visible domestic spaces of exotic others. As we shall see, so-called private spaces were commodified: marriage and sexual relations were explored, translated into narrative capital, and consumed by the “domestic” English reading public. Falconbridge dramatizes domesticity as a way to articulate colonial concerns, and she uses the female body as a marker of cultural difference. In these (sometimes troubling) ways, she elevates the condition of women to national and political importance. In her narrative, domestic sustains114 Adventures in Domesticity several meanings: domestic as the realm of the private or personal has intersected with domestic as national. Although her use of this double meaning often aligned her with abolitionist writers, I will later argue that her personal domestic affairs influenced her brief and unusual proslavery argument at the end of her text and that this mode of domestic discourse reorganizes colonial discourse written by men. Anna Maria Falconbridge's Narrative of Two Voyages to the River Sierra Leone During the Years 1791-1792, one of the few travelogues written by a woman in the eighteenth century, records the founding of Freetown (February 1792) as a colony for free blacks in England.' Falconbridge voyages to Sierra Leone from England with her physician husband, who was appointed by Parliamentary Member Henry Thornton to the governing Council of the Sierra Leone Settlement. Thornton, John Clarkson (who would be the first governor of Sierra Leone), his brother Thomas, and abolitionists Granville Sharp and William Wilberforce formed the West African enterprise during the time the House of Commons was debating abolition. The Sierra Leone resettlement plan was popularized in London by this Clapham sect abolitionist group, who advertised in the Gentleman's Magazine. It was also written about by two former African slaves, Quobna Ottobah Cugoano and Olaudah Equiano, who published accounts of their lives and expressed interest in the plan. The colony struggled with mismanagement and disease for three years until a French attack burned the town in 1794. Shortly thereafter, Jamaican Maroons settled in a rebuilt Freetown, which became a British colony just before the turn of the century. Falconbridge's first husband, Alexander, had written An Account of the Slave Trade on the Coast of Africa (1788) and “testified before the Privy Council about the hideous conditions he witnessed as a doctor on the Middle Passage”Domesticating the Colony 115 (Ferguson 198). The directors of the Sierra Leone plan felt his experience as a slaveship surgeon and his abolitionist beliefs qualified him to serve in the colony. But his hot temper gave the Council in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and the directors in London cause for worry. It also alienated Anna Maria, who wrote that she did not regret it when he drank himself to death after only a year in the colony. She is unrestrained in her expressed antipathy for him: “I really do not (regret his death], his life had become burthensome to himself and all around him, and his conduct to me, for more than two years past, was so unkind, (not to give a harsher term) as long since to wean every spark of affection or regard I ever had for him” (169-70). Anna Maria Falconbridge's narrative was originally written as letters to a woman friend but, she claims, has been recast and published as a book in order to help her recover money owed to her by the Company. Falconbridge claims that Henry Thornton cheated her out of salary rightfully hers as Alexander Falconbridge's widow. In the last letter of her narrative, she accuses the directors of the Company of shirking their responsibilities to her: How can your Honorable Court, formed, as it is, of Members of Parliament, Bankers, and some of the first Merchants in the City of London, all professing the quintessence of philanthropy, thus depreciate its worth by being guilty of such gross meanness? I verily believe it would be impossible to cull from the Migratory Chapmen of Rag Fair, any number of men who would not blush to be detected in a similar transaction. (284) And she unleashes the full force of her righteous indignation: "For shame, Mr. Thornton, for shame!!!" (285).116 Adventures in Domesticity Even John Clarkson's private correspondence indicates his belief that, because of Alexander Falconbridge's alcoholism and passionate temper, the Company would be unwilling to pay her his back salary: “The Company are now so very frugal that I should not wonder if they hesitate paying the money as they all exclaim against Falconbridge."9 In an earlier, private letter, Thomas Clarkson wrote to his brother John that the Sierra Leone London directors worried about Alexander Falconbridge's growing influence in the colony: “I come now to the subject of Falconbridge, all of which is for your own privacy and Conduct ... the Directors ... do not approve his Conduct. They consider him as hot, rash, and impetuous; as likely to involve us in wars, and as perhaps not over careful how he offends those united with him in office.” The long letter concludes with a warning: "it would be a pity that the noble Object of our Institution should be hazarded by the Impetuosity and warmth of temper of an individual, or that we, with so large a Capital should be wholly at his [Falconbridge's mercy.”° Clarkson's letters detail what Anna Maria's hinted at and help explain the political nature of her journal. Anna Maria Falconbridge stayed in Freetown after Alexander's death (December 1792), remaining active in the sociopolitics of the developing colony. She became fully enmeshed in the governing of Sierra Leone, writing philosophically and politically charged letters from her house, which was something of a hub of local political talk and activity (218, 219, 225, ex). After a token period of mourning, she married Issac Dubois, a successful and charming Nova Scotian merchant who was involved in the resettlement of English blacks. What little is known about him derives from his unpublished diary and private correspondence with John Clarkson. As I will discuss later in the chapter, it is only through his journal that we have details about their marriage, since Anna Maria says nearly nothing about her romantic lifeDomesticating the Colony 117 in the colony." The dual focus of her narrative — domestic affairs and political affairs – makes her text an exemplary instance of the ways women travel writers politicized domesticity by dramatizing it. As we shall see, her ability to use a strategic femininity to her rhetorical advantage complicates her representation of the colony and of cultural others. Her rhetorical maneuvering registers a critical ambivalence about the role of women in colonial situations and about cultural difference. I will argue that this vexed position offers us a way to rethink English domesticity and national identity in a transatlantic context. In the passage that opens this chapter, Falconbridge's participation in the transformation of the darkened prostitutes serves as a signature not only of her domestic white womanhood, but also of her Englishness. She ends the scene with an indictment of her country, repining that “it is scarcely possible that the British Government, at this advanced and enlightened age, envied and admired as it is by the universe, could be capable of exercising or countenancing such a Gothic infringement on human Liberty” (66). By ending her narration of this episode with nationalist discourse that locates Britain at the center of the colonial orbit, she guides her gentle reader to national concerns via a gendered terrain. It is her feminine sensible eye that bears witness, and it is the seductively lurid description of transgressive sexual practices (prostitution and miscegenation) that serves as the site on which questions of sex, gender, and colonialism are negotiated. The description of the sexual activity of the displaced women as “more brutish” than ordinary is based upon their intercourse with African men, and is meant to initiate a specifically imperial defense of white women's sexuality. Thus her passage also evokes contemporary fears about miscegenation that permeated both abolitionist and proslavery writing in the late eighteenth century. Miscegenation,118 Adventures in Domesticity illegitimacy, and disease were all considered infectious dangers primarily transmitted through women's sexual or reproductive capabilities. Consider why Falconbridge describes the "iniquities” of prostitution as more “brutish” when practiced in Africa in light of the following popular beliefs about miscegenation. In the years preceding her narrative, West Indian sugar planters, colonial agents, and British politicians pressed for legislation to protect the racial purity of Englishmen and women through antimiscegenation and immigration laws. One West Indian agent advocated immigration laws as a way to "preserve the race of Britons from stain and contamination” (Freyer 156). A 1773 article in the London Chronicle exclaimed that action must be taken to “save the natural beauty of Britain from the Morisco tint" (156). Similar fears were echoed in the Gentlemen's Magazine in 1764, when one writer bemoaned the “disgraceful” “mixture of their breed with our own" (155). Perhaps the most widely read writer on racial mixing was Jamaican planter, Edward Long, who warned against the gradual “contamination with this mixture.” Miscegenation was, in his view, “a venomous and dangerous ulcer,” a “malignancy” that would darken the English race through widespread “infection.”'. As this language suggests, the fear of cultural hybrids and mixed blood people was habitually articulated in terms of disease and contamination." By examining the image of the diseased woman in a colonial context, I am able to explore one of the discursive connections between colonialism and domesticity: a widespread fear that sexual, physical, and social infection would be imported from African colonies along with other colonial goods. The critical ambivalence of women travel writers toward these tropes – the body, adulteration, disease, and cleansing – and their ambivalence toward femininity complicates our understanding of eighteenth- century colonial discourse.Domesticating the Colony 119 As I said earlier, Falconbridge uses women as markers of cultural difference and sometimes uses the trope of disease to negotiate scenes of colonial contact. As in conventional travel accounts, she connects physical sickness with social vice; her body is weakened by climactic dangers and social affronts alike. Late in her narrative, Falconbridge describes a fever she contracted while on board a different slave ship carrying human cargo from Jamaica to Bristol. Fever is personified as an enemy who is “ill-natured [and] contagious.” Cast as a virtual stowaway, the disease did not “discover itself in the ship’ until they had been at sea for three days. And when she gets sick, she says she is "attacked” (229). But she is saved from "falling a victim to its barbarity” (230). At the end of her narrative and after two years in the colony, she describes slavery in similar terms, saying she had forborne voyaging on a slave ship for she had “always entertained most horrid notions of being exposed to indelicacies, too offensive for the eye of an English woman” (232, my emphasis). Physical sickness and the offenses of the slave trade are both diseases to which Falconbridge must avoid being “exposed.” Eighteenth-century travel writers and abolitionists often associated slavery with disease, but they also cultivated the trope of disease in their descriptions of faraway places. Typical accounts described the West African coast as "insalubrious," "unwholesome," and dangerously contagious: "a thick, stinking and sulphurous Damp or Mist so spreads itself, and falls so thick on the Earth, that it is almost impossible to escape the Infection ... and our Bodies are more susceptible of it than the Natives” (Bosman 105). Such narratives warn that the "malign effects” of the coast are exacerbated by African customs, a rhetorical move that unites people and place in a marriage of physical sickness and cultural vice. But, as in Falconbridge's description of the Lapwing Cutter that took her to Sierra Leone on her first120 Adventures in Domesticity voyage, noxious air and dangerous people assault her senses even before she reaches shore. Her portrayal of the English slave-trading ship on which she had passage to Sierra Leone uses the related trope of filth to describe the ills of the slave trade: Conceive yourself pent up in a floating cage, without room either to walk about, stand erect, or even to lay at length; exposed to the inclemency of the weather, having your eyes and ears momently offended by acts of indecency, and language too horrible to relate — add to this a complication of filth, the stench from which was continually assailing your nose, and then you will have a faint notion of the Lapwing Cutter. (24) In the preceding passage, from one of the first letters of her narrative, Falconbridge identifies herself as a virtuous white Englishwoman who must guard against the contaminating filth of colonial life. But it also reverses the rhetorical move of abolitionist writers to feminize social ills. Moreover, the logic of her argument anticipates Victorian attitudes toward disease, the social body, and cultural others. Mary Poovey has argued that early-nineteenth-century social theorists "conflated physical disease with moral failings epitomized by domestic improvidence” (72). Such formulations, she demonstrates, worked to vilify the poor and the Irish, and simultaneously characterized the English as domestic, virtuous, and socially salutary." This is similar to the dynamic Falconbridge creates, where colonial commerce is, at least early in her narrative, described as a social ill or as social filth that must be cleansed by the domestic Englishwoman. On the one hand, this self- portrait is consistent with contemporary figurations of women as moral guardians made popular by the cult of domesticity andDomesticating the Colony 121 by the popularity of sentimental literature. It is also consistent with the association of women with domestic chores like cleaning, laundering, or dressing. But her identity as domestic, virtuous Englishwoman disassociates her from the social dirt and disease of the slave ship. Recall, too, that in the scene with the darkened prostitutes, Falconbridge's brand of femininity guards against contamination from empire's ills. Women occupy several positions: Falconbridge is the domestic guardian who cleanses and dresses the prostitutes' social dirt and disease. Similarly, on the slave ship, she will not allow the ship's vice to spread. Instead, she pits female virtue against the filth of slavery embodied in the slave-ship: recollecting there was no remedy but to make the best of my situation, I begged the master ... to have the cabin thoroughly cleaned and washed with vinegar; intreated Falconbridge to let me go on shore while it was doing, and hinted at the indecencies I saw and heard, and was promised they would be prevented in future. (24) Falconbridge's self-portrait as idealized woman of offended delicacy uses the language of domestic virtue to camouflage the voyages West Africans made to England during the middle passage in entirely different “floating cages.” Thus Falconbridge imagines slavery as a social filth that domestic ideology can cleanse; the strength of feminine delicacy is that it can “cleanse and wash” offending “acts of indecency" without requiring a middle-class woman's physical presence for such social launderings. She steadfastly refuses to catch the figurative infection of empire's vices, displacing the trope of disease only onto lower-class women's bodies, as we saw in the passage that opened this chapter. As we shall see,122 Adventures in Domesticity Falconbridge often uses the female body as a marker of cultural difference. By creating a metaphoric taxonomy of women, her narrative complicates colonial discourses' feminization of cultural vice. Her ideal of domesticity resembled contemporary abolitionist fiction in that it figured domestic white Englishwomen as guardians of national virtue. Relying on sentimental plots, women writers of abolitionist poetry, prose, and letters emphasized the importance of domestic virtues to Christianity, morality, and national identity; and portrayed as diseased economic arguments in favor of plantation slavery. In so doing, they refocused antislavery debates by changing the terms of public discourse. Domesticity achieved ideological currency primarily based upon the image of the "angel in the house," a virtuous white Englishwoman who performed moral rather than physical labor, and who was both desexualized and maternalized. Women writers used feminine moral superiority to establish their credibility and authority. Women's sentimental abolitionist fiction dramatized social ills by employing the trope of disease. For example, Mary Robinson's poem, "The Progress of Liberty” (1798), uses the same language to define slavery as did other abolitionist writers like Anne Yearsley and Anna Letitia Barbauld. Slavery is a “contagion” that “violate[s]” “nature's laws,” and produces “infamous” children. Legitimacy, patriarchal laws of property transmission, and social status in particular, bondage) were all linked to the maternal line. At the same time that women were portrayed as responsible for social corruption, they were viewed as capable of curing social ills by accessing disembodied sentimental virtue. For instance, in milkwoman-turned-poet Ann Yearsley's well-publicized “A Poem on the Inhumanity of the Slave-Trade” (1788), feminine traits assuage the pain of Luco, a kind old slave whom Yearsley depicts as a martyr burned at the stake. Condemned to die a brutal death, Luco is tortured asDomesticating the Colony 123 punishment for his act of violent self-defense against a cruel overseer. Her poem relies on domesticity and femininity to argue its position. Luco “escape[s]” physical torture through his feminized soul (304) and through familial love. While women are associated with nature, it is not in an embodied and debased way, as was typical of adventure fiction or natural histories written predominantly by men. Instead, nature is equated with “laws divine” or “deep philosophy," which Yearsley calls most often “social love." The putatively feminine realm of feeling lords over the male realm of politics and law, a move that accords public power to domesticity and, by extension, to women. “Social love” is depicted as the solution to the “savage” slave trade. Social love is the feminized “True soul of order,” a “gentle angel! [who can) Spread thy silken wings/ O’er drowsy man, breathe in his soul, and givel Her godlike pow'rs thy animating forcel To banish inhumanity” (389-95). Souls are feminine — importantly, even when they are the souls of male slaves (304), and perhaps even more important, feminized souls have the power to effect action in the material world of politics and socioeconomics. Luco and Yearsley's voices merge in the last line of his plea “From the dissolving scene.' Oh, social love” (414), and the reader sees that domestic sentiment levels both race and gender distinction into transcendental “social love." Yearsley's voice follows his with her penultimate stanza: ... Oh, social love, thou universal good, thou that canst fill the Vacuum of immensity, and live In endless void! Thou that in motion first Set'st the long lazy atoms, by thy force Quickly assimilating, and restrained By strong attraction — touch the soul of man; Subdue him; make a fellow-creature's woe124 Adventures in Domesticity His own by heartfelt sympathy, whilst wealth is made subservient to his soft disease. (414-23) Yearsley calls social love “universal"; it is the essence of Christian virtue which, spoken by a slave who laments the loss of “Parental fondness, and the dear returns/ Of filial tenderness,” is defined by familial affection. Slaves who feel such affection are elevated to the status of "fellow-creatures." This is the social love that opposes the slave trade; the economics of slave-labor are thus countered by a divine, naturalized, and feminized domestic ideology. “Disease” in Yearsley's poem is perhaps dis-ease: the lack of ease or comfort, a mild word to express the brutality of slavery, but a compelling choice when considered next to the use of “disease” in other antislavery poems. Thus, both capacities — the capacity for embodying vice and for disembodying sentimental virtue — structured women's abolitionist writing. In her “Epistle to William Wilberforce, Esq. On the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade, 1791,” Anna Letitia Barbauld eschews sentimental plot in favor of a broad condemnation of England's decision to perpetuate the slave trade. Vice is feminized and is described in relation to procreation and infectious disease. Using an argument that became widespread at the turn of the century in England and America, Barbauld cautions that the trade in slaves corrupts Englishmen and women. She fears a society where virtue is blunted and “avarice prevail[s]”: “In Britain's senate, Misery's pangs give birth/To jests unseemly, and to horrid mirth.” Apathy and mockery, the antithesis of sentimental virtue, are the monstrous twin children of a corrupt society. The trade breeds “vice,” whose “contagion” and “sickly languors” threaten to corrupt both Africa and England. In language similar to that used to describe miscegenation, Barbauld callsDomesticating the Colony 125 vice a "fiery venom" that infects “The milky innocence of infant veins” (175-76). Woman is the symbol of national identity, and the curse of slavery has deformed what “nature” intended to be a harmless and virtuous creature. Woman's “finer joy[s]” are overshadowed by “sensual riot,” and the desire for colonial goods is described as a ubiquitous infection: "on essenced wings, Breathing unnamed perfumes, contagion springs.” The desire for colonial goods and the inhumanity that results from that desire is called “corruption,” a “spreading leprosy [that] taints every part.” Its disease cripples the social body, “Infect[ing] each limb, and sicken[ing]... the heart.” And like the child of mixed blood parents, England's social body will not benefit from slavery's products, but will instead suffer from slavery's “stain.” Falconbridge's description of the darkened prostitutes in the passage that opened this chapter takes on an interesting meaning when considered in this context. Her role as guardian of social or national virtue would seem to contrast with the feminization of the ills of empire in colonial discourse. As a comparison with the language in the above poems demonstrates, Falconbridge's description of the prostitutes as "so decrepid with disease, and so disgusted with filth and dirt, that I should never have supposed they were born white” (64), unites two related usages of the trope of disease. It uses a class differential to simultaneously invoke the trope of the diseased woman and the virtuous woman, a split that is inflected with racial difference within a colonial context. The displacement of the trope of disease onto the female figure is the result of avoiding a confrontation with the physical cost of colonial trade; Englishmen and women consumed colonial goods at the expense of African and Afro- Caribbean people." In one of the few other eighteenth-century travelogues written by a woman, Janet Shaw wrestles with the discursive problematic of dramatizing domesticity in order to126 Adventures in Domesticity articulate cultural difference within a colonial setting. Her Journal of a Lady of Quality; Being the Narrative of a Journey from Scotland to the West Indies, North Carolina, and Portugal, in the years 1774 to 1776 resists colonial discourse's conflation of vice with feminine diseases. But it endorses an association of disease with racial and class others. She describes the customary presentation of a dram of water by an Afro-Caribbean servant to a white Creole thus: “It is presented to you in a Cocoa nut shell ornamented with Silver, at the end of a hickory handle. This is lest the breath of the Servant who presents it should contaminate its purity” (110-11). The trope of contamination — bedrock to the logic of a slave society where produce from slave labor is ingested by bourgeois and aristocratic white Englishmen and women only after it has been processed through a variety of economic and social launderings — persists in Shaw's narrative." Although the language of disease is invoked to express the need to keep separate racial and class others, the trope emerges here in relation to racial and class others rather than through the female figure. Similarly, when Shaw discovers a group of emigrants huddled below deck on her voyage to Antigua from Edinburgh, she condenses racial and class difference in her description: Never did my eyes behold so wretched, so disgusting a sight. They looked like a Cargo of Dean Swift's Yahoos newly caught ... It was impossible to account for this strange apparition, till the Captain informed me, that they were a company of Emigrants, whom the owner had made him smuggle aboard privately, and had ordered to be kept close under the hatches till we were out at sea. (28)Domesticating the Colony 127 Using Jonathan Swift's classic trope from Gulliver's Travels, her description resonates with the language of empire. Class others are situated on the lower rung of the racially hierarchical human ladder. Like slaves (or the prostitutes Falconbridge describes, or even seamen who were impressed into service), the emigrants are “caught.” But she later discovers that they are reformable. Shocked out of recognizing them at first, Shaw tells her reader that the emigrants undergo a startling transformation: “Where are now the Cargo of Yahoos? they are transformed into a Company of most respectable sufferers, whom it is both my duty and inclination to comfort, and do all in my power to alleviate their misfortunes, which have not sprung from their guilt or folly, but from the guilt and folly of others” (36). Both Shaw and Falconbridge view themselves as duty bound to assist those less fortunate than themselves, though Shaw will only help her shipmates once they have transformed into “respectable sufferers.” Confronted with the economic and sexual structures of empire, both women posit a sympathetic and virtuous white femininity as a means of ameliorating the ills of empire. Throughout her travelogue, Falconbridge wields a stylized femininity in order to narrate her politicized domestic situation and to vocalize criticism about empire. The colonial and the feminine are connected in Falconbridge's narrative; she alternately positions herself as colonist and as woman, often using one subject position to criticize the other." For instance, early in the work, Falconbridge mitigates the expression of her enjoyment at dinner with Naimbana, a regional King in Sierra Leone. She assures the reader that she does not have an inflated sense of her self-worth because of her socially and politically important activities:128 Adventures in Domesticity methinks, I hear you saying, “Why the week [sic] mind of this giddy girl will be quite intoxicated with the courtesy and attention paid her by such great folks;" but believe me, to whatever height of self-consequence I may have been lifted by aerial fancies, overpouring sleep prevailed, and clouding all my greatness — I awoke next morning without the slightest remains of fancied importance. (45) Like many women travel writers, Falconbridge dresses her text in feminine flourish, often using a language of sentiment that is highly evocative and that meets with accepted forms of women's published writing. Yet, here as elsewhere, her “aerial fancies” are grounded and she wakes up sober and (relatively) humble. Here is another example of how Falconbridge uses domestic concerns and gender codes to negotiate her relationship with cultural others. Her impulse to clothe the inhabitants of the region extends to the local king and queen, whose unsuitable regal vestments vitiate, in Falconbridge's view, their authority. She obsesses over King Naimbana's “thread stockings": "he was dressed in a purple embroidered coat, white sattin [sic] waistcoat and breeches, thread stockings, and his left side emblazoned with a flaming star; his legs to be sure were harliquined, by a number of holes in the stockings, through which his black skin appeared” (34). Vexed by the outfit, she repeats her observations several pages later, expressing her desire to whitewash the king by stitching his costume to conceal the “black skin”: “I often had an inclination to offer my services to close the holes: but was fearful least my needle might blunder into his Majesty's leg, and start the blood" (39). Here again is the trope of blood corruption: epidermal transgression would be equivalent to social transgression.20 More frustrating than the king whomDomesticating the Colony 129 Falconbridge wishes to refashion is the queen who, like her husband, “had neither shoes nor stockings on” (44). Indeed, Falconbridge takes the earliest opportunity to recast the regal image in her own narrative of decorum. Lunching with the wife of a local Temmne dignitary, to whom she gives the Europeanized name Clara, she says: “I endeavoured to persuade her to dress in the European way, but to no purpose; she would tear the clothes off her back immediately after I put them on. Finding no credit could be gained by trying to new fashion this Ethiopian Princess, I got rid of her as soon as possible” (61-62). Unlike the darkened white prostitutes who become the recipients of a new wardrobe, Clara refuses to be refashioned according to Falconbridge's notions of sensibility. Failing in her efforts to recode the African women dignitaries, Falconbridge no longer courts their interest. Her indignation is a mark of both colonial and feminine authority and, like her response to the darkened prostitutes, signals her use of the female body as a marker of cultural difference. As I have said, her stylized femininity often enables her to engage in political discourse. In the first letter sent from Africa, she writes about seeing the slave yard at the Bance Island Factory: Delicacy, perhaps, prevented the gentlemen from taking me to see them ... Involuntarily I strolled to one of the windows a little before dinner, without the smallest suspicion of what I was to see; — judge then what my astonishment and feelings were, at the sight of between two and three hundred wretched victims, chained and parcelled out in circles, just satisfying the cravings of nature from a trough of rice placed in the centre of each circle. (32)130 Adventures in Domesticity The “trough of rice” in the yard grotesquely mimics the location from which she views it: "the room where we dined looks directly into the yard” (32). She hungrily consumes this spectacle, apologizing for her transfixed gaze: "Offended modesty rebuked me with a blush for not hurrying my eyes from such disgusting scenes; but whether fascinated by female curiosity, or whatever else, I couldn't withdraw myself for several minutes" (33). This spectacular scene reminds her that female "delicacy" should debar her from masculine ocular activities. But the few moments of feminine pause are vitiated by the mobility she conceals from her husband. One afternoon, after he has gone to a palaver (in this case, a meeting to discuss legal matters), Falconbridge ventures to Bance Island, passing the day with a French slave trader. That night, she writes of her husband: "as he did not ask how I had spent the day, I did not inform him" (59). Falconbridge manipulates notions of female delicacy to afford her greater freedom, for she "feigned sickness" (58) that day, the day after she claimed to have had "hysterics" (55) at the first palaver they attended together. Her mendacity registers the ambivalence of her position. She manipulates the trope of the diseased woman (indeed, what disease was considered more feminine than hysteria?), using gender conventions to her advantage. And we are able to see how she freely circulates throughout the country by virtue of her ability to artfully manipulate what has been described as natural. The drama of femininity offers physical and narrative freedom. 21 Aware that her look initiated her private discourse on the public conversation about the slave yard, she is also aware that, as a virtuous woman of an enlightened country, she must guard against the impropriety of the conversation instigated by that look. The way Falconbridge avoids sullying her literary skirts, by feigning sickness and hysteria, resembles the kind of subversive mimicry of strategized femininity Luce IrigarayDomesticating the Colony 131 theorizes in This Sex Which Is Not One. Irigaray suggests that mimicry can be an effective destabilizing force that can make visible, by an effect of playful repetition, what was supposed to remain invisible" (76).22 In mimicking fashion, as Irigaray describes it, Falconbridge's repeated claims to female delicacy become mocking by the end of her narrative: it is clear she is no delicate, weak-minded girl. Moreover, the moments of feminine specularity in the text, often facilitated and framed by female delicacy, curiously shift the narrative focus away from the spectacular object and back to the looking subject. By calling attention to the shock characteristic of her unauthorized female gaze, Falconbridge directs the reader to herself, to her who has become the overseer of this narrative of colonial and gender identity production. Falconbridge's feminine mimicry assumes several shades of meaning when we consider that her subject position is determined not only by her gender but by her position as Englishwoman in an African colony. Homi Bhabha's theory of “colonial mimicry” views subject formation as fragmented or, to use his term, “ambivalent.” He figures a colonial subject whose partialness inherently reveals the fissures in what had been conceived of as a monolithic wall of subjectivity: "colonial mimicry is the desire for a reformed, recognizable Other, as a subject of a difference that is almost the same, but not quite. Which is to say, that the discourse of mimicry is constructed around an ambivalence; in order to be effective, mimicry must continually produce its slippage, its excess, its difference” (86). Falconbridge calls into question the ties between female sexuality and commerce that strengthened the matrix of colonial trade by manipulating her complicated subject position: she refuses to overlook the traffic in female sexuality by bearing witness, transcribing the testimony of abducted sex workers, and condemning the British government's "Gothic infringement on human Liberty"(66).23132 Adventures in Domesticity The spectacular scene at Bance Island is an exemplary moment of narrative rupture, where Falconbridge strategically positions herself in the role of delicate female. This positioning is what allows her the freedom to witness the slave- yard scene. In the preface to the spectacle, she writes that "delicacy, perhaps, prevented the gentlemen from taking me to see them" and that she "involuntarily strolled to one of the windows" that overlooked the slave yard (32). Pratt calls Falconbridge's “reluctance to know” a form of “anti- conquest.” Asserting that her "curiosity (desire) marked as female is in need of control,” Pratt contends that “seeing violates norms of conduct for her gender” (104). But Falconbridge invokes social codes of genteel behavior in order to break them, all without owning the responsibility for having done so. It is in spite of delicacy, and involuntarily that she sees the slave yard, these extenuations creating a safe and subversive space for looking within a literal and figurative space that is intended to prevent her from doing so. Perhaps this is the “anti-conquest,” a moment of desire and seeing that excuses itself at the moment of the look. Later in her narrative, Falconbridge's writing becomes less overtly nuanced by gender. By 1793, two years after she first arrives in the colony, her gentle disapprobation of the Sierra Leone Company's policies has transformed into angry reproof, and she engages in direct condemnation of them with phrases like "Did you ever hear of any thing more ridiculously despotic?” (218). She breaks the silence resulting from her "conscious[ness) of a woman's insignificance” (110). She is clearly enmeshed in the politics of local rule, frequently participating in social and political meetings at her house, which has become a locus of local community politics. Moreover, she abandons complaints about writing; where, in the beginning, she would bemoan the "fatigue" inherent in the act of writing (51), she is later quick to recount as much as possible, including transcriptions of Company correspondence.Domesticating the Colony 133 She now socializes unapologetically with members of the political community; no longer does she characterize herself as a "giddy girl" (45). And now we can even reconsider that early scene of self-deprecation after her dinner with King Naimbana, reading her modesty as serving the very function it claims to eschew: calling attention to her place at the center of the political scene. Janet Shaw, whose travels I began to describe above, similarly manipulated gender conventions in her descriptions of Antigua. Her critical ambivalence about stereotypical descriptions of women is visible in her description of the Creole women of Antigua. She writes: As to the women, they are in general the most amiable creatures in the world, and either I have been remarkably fortunate in my acquaintance, or they are more than commonly sensible, even those who have never been off the Island are amazingly intelligent and able to converse with you on any subject. They make excellent wives, fond attentive mothers and the best house wives I have ever met with. Those of the first fortune and fashion keep their own keys and look after everything within doors; the domestick Economy is entirely left to them. (113) And she concludes: “I never admired my own sex more than in these amiable Creoles. Their sentiments are just and virtuous” (114). Compare her account with one more typical of the day. John Luffman's A brief account of the island of Antigua, together with the customs and manners of its inhabitants, as well white as black: . . . In letters to a friend, published in 1789, like many contemporary fictive accounts of the134 ntu Adventures in Domesticity Caribbean, and like most natural histories and travelogues, characterizes Creole women as lascivious and languid: The ladies, inhabitants of this place, seldom walk the streets or ride in their wiskys, without masks or veils, not I presume, altogether as a preservative to their complexion, being frequently seen at a distance unmasked, but as soon as they are approached near, on goes the vizor, thro’ which, by a couple of peep-holes, about the size of an English shilling, they have an opportunity of staring in the faces of all they meet. With you, this would be termed the grossest ill-manners, but here custom has established it, if not necessary as fashionable. Their dress is generally light, and inclined to tawdry, and their conversation languid. (114) Luffman's description orientalizes Creole women, and he bemoans the lack of modesty and the use of the veil as a means of agency, as a vehicle for an unauthorized female gaze. His complaint about tawdry dress, languid conversation, and the veil is that Creole women reverse the terms of patriarchy by controlling the outer signs of their sexual identity.24 He also subscribes to the popular belief Nussbaum detailed in Torrid Zones, that temperature determined temperament, and any inhabitant of the West Indies was sure to have a fiery temper. But Shaw questions the terms of that discourse by attempting to rearticulate some of the gender conventions on the island. Her only complaint about the Englishwomen born and living on the Caribbean island is that their “masks and bonnets” prevent the bloom of good health to color their cheeks. In response to the “masks and bonnets” of her Creole friends, she writes: “As to your humble Servant, I have always set my face to the weather; wherever I have been. I hope youDomesticating the Colony 135 have no quarrel at brown beauty” (115). Having turned a convention of racialized beauty on its head, she then boasts her ability to manipulate other conventions of femininity. Of her “delicacy,” she says: “I find I can put it on and take it off like any piece of dress” (201). By broadening the boundaries of femininity to give Creole women access to domestic virtue, she challenges a central tenet of colonial discourse. Most late- eighteenth-century natural histories and travelogues stereotype Creole women as lascivious and slothful. Represented as English in body but African in culture, white Creoles embodied the threat of African and West Indian enculturation. Efforts to legislate sexuality through antimiscegenation laws were attempts to contain the infection of black blood into the English social body.25 But Shaw does not feminize the sexual vices of the islands. Indeed, she boldly asserts: The sun appears to affect the sexes very differently. While the men are gay , luxurious and amorous, the women are modest, genteel, reserved and temperate. This last virtue they have indeed in the extreme; they drink nothing stronger in general than Sherbet, and never eat above one or two things at table, and these the lightest and plainest. The truth is, I can observe no indulgence they allow themselves in. (113) Thus, in spite of the body of natural history that had developed ideas about the geographical and gendered influences of temperature on temperament, Shaw not only makes a claim for the temperance of Creole women, but, as she later states, attempts to introduce to them some "indulgences” by encouraging them to drink madiera.26 While Shaw makes no abolitionist assertions, she does suggest broadening women's participation in the sociopolitical activities of empire: women136 Adventures in Domesticity ought to internalize colonial ideology by ingesting its products.27 Critics who have endeavored to negotiate the tension between discourses of colonialism and gender difference have suggested that the structural effects of femininity often undercut the force of the colonial (e.g., Mills 22-23). But Indira Ghose argues that the doubly removed gaze of the female, often situated within the context of aesthetic or domestic rhetoric, is the ultimate form of colonial discourse, for its self-presentation as innocent observer naturalizes colonial power more subtly and effectively than overt colonialist texts: “By constructing themselves as busy collecting picturesque scenes of curios or flowers, . . . looking on while men managed the dirty business of politics, women travellers epitomize the stance of British women in empire — as located outside of historical and material conditions" (9). This resembles what Mary Louise Pratt has dubbed “anti- conquest,” writing that strives to identify itself as innocent and transcendent.28 But Falconbridge's narrative is not outside of historical conditions, as her use of a kind of Bahktinian multivocality at the end of her narrative illustrates. Many eighteenth- and nineteenth-century slave narratives, like The Life of Olaudah Equiano, The History of Mary Prince, Harriet Jacobs's Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, or Frederick Douglass's Narrative of the Life, include subscription lists, letters attesting to the veracity of the account, or other letters of authentication, such as proof of manumission. In a sort of weird reversal of these narratives, Falconbridge appends to her travelogue transcriptions or interpretations (it is unclear at times) of letters from black settlers addressed to Henry Thornton, the London- based director of the Sierra Leone Company. Thus her account of the unsettled business of the colony is validated by corresponding documents, and continues for twenty pages in a sustained attack against Henry Thornton's dealings with theDomesticating the Colony 137 settlers. She (re)produces the letters of two “Representatives for the Inhabitants of Free Town” (265) in a series of exchanges with Thornton. They appear to be straightforward redactions — the letters are surrounded by quote marks — but she introduces them as near transcriptions: These unfortunate oppressed people (the Deputies have related to me most minutely every circumstance that has befallen them since their arrival in this country; and, as you seem interested in their behalf, and desire to know what success they have met with, I will repeat their narrative nearly in their own words. (254) She includes letters from the representatives, Cato Perkins and Isaac Anderson (who was a free Nova Scotian settler), as well as from Henry Thornton and John Clarkson, which articulate the disputes over land settlement, taxes, and the general mistrust the settler had of the Company's London directors: “We have been so often deceived by white people, that we are jealous when they make any promises, and uneasily wait till we see what they will come to” (264). Thus, in Falconbridge's narrative, the letters that follow her account of the colony are from black settlers appended in order to lend credibility to her account. Upon first reading, one is tempted to say that she collapses the hierarchy of subjectivity by giving voice to the people she describes, the people for whom she politically advocates. But it is important to remember that, in plotting the politics of her narration, the settlers' letters partially constitute, are circumscribed by, and are in dialogue with her own letters. Mills calls this move a kind of “discursive instability” (7): “This lack of a stable position enables us to read these texts less as simply replications of or reaffirmations of colonial rule, but rather as symptoms of the contradictions inherent in that power relation"138 Adventures in Domesticity (197-98). Whether the feminine gaze undercuts or more insidiously supports this colonial gesture, it is clear that the positions do not exist separately, but mutually construct one another. The problematic of narrating sexual and domestic affairs in a colonial setting had personal resonance for Falconbridge. Her marriage to Issac Dubois two weeks after the death of her first husband, Alexander Falconbridge, makes her a Creole by marriage since Dubois was a Frenchman born in the British colony, Nova Scotia, and transplanted to Sierra Leone. In such transatlantic contexts, national identity was less than fixed. Falconbridge's description of her second marriage betrays an awareness of the rhetorical usefulness of dramatizing domestic concerns. The important gaps in her story are interestingly filled in by her second husband's unpublished diary. Further, when she asks her correspondent friend not to “sully me with reproach,” her language invokes the trope of disease and contamination. For the first time, Falconbridge almost associates herself with the trope of the diseased woman – a move, I will argue, that connects domestic concerns with colonialism in unusual ways. Falconbridge confines commentary on her second marriage to two brief references. In a letter dated 15 February 1793, she writes: “My dinner on the 21st of January will somewhat puzzle you at first, and lest you may not at once hit upon what occasioned it, I must acquaint you I have changed the name of Falconbridge for one a little shorter, under which I beg to subscribe myself" (209). Not only does she fail to indicate what this shorter name is, but for the sake of appearance, she lies about the date of her marriage. Issac Dubois's journal, written to John Clarkson (former governor of the colony) after his departure from Sierra Leone, narrates the business affairs of the colony, from local political relations to the politics of construction and food supply, and also offers brief details of his relationship withDomesticating the Colony 139 Falconbridge. On 3 January 1793, he commissioned his wedding ring - twenty-four days after Alexander Falconbridge's death. On 6 January 1793, he writes that his "absence... puts me out of humour which my neighbor takes for indifference towards her, and gets quite in a fit however a reconsiliation is quickly brought about, and we agree to be married to morrow” (January 6).29 His journal entry for the next day describes the social implication of their marriage, putting a humorous twist on Falconbridge's reticence to openly own their marriage: At 9 O Clock this morning the Reverend Mr. Horne performed the marriage ceremony and now I am once more, I trust, happyly joined in the bonds of wedlock, we intended our marriage should be kept a secret till the 21% of this month [and] Mr. Horne had promised to do so, but the poor parson was not born to keep secrets, he carried it piping hot to the ears of every one he met but desired every one he told it to, not to mention it to any one — however in less than two hours it was known over the whole Colony - it made very little difference to me whether it was known today or a fortnight hence — I am happy [and] the Parson is pleased at telling the news. (January 7) Dubois's record indicates that in the displaced colonial home, the bodice of female virtue was often loosened, accommodating social mobility in a way that it could not in Britain. The news of their union, carried “piping hot” on the lips of the Reverend, is portrayed as good-natured; it is not the wildfire of rapidly spreading gossip, and he gives little quarter to his wife's concerns about delicacy and appearances.140 Adventures in Domesticity But Falconbridge is aware of the dramatic capital of domestic affairs, and she is able to cash in on propriety. Only five months after her marriage, she raises the topic for the last time. Writing to her friend on 5 June 1793, she curries acquittal from her “dear Madam”: I Finished my last by hinting that I had once more enlisted under the banners of Hymen, but made no apology for my hastiness; or, in other words, for deviating from the usual custom of twelve months widowhood. To be plain, I did not make any, because I thought it unnecessary. Narrow minds may censure me, and perhaps the powerful influence of habit, might operate against me in your opinion, before you reflected upon my situation, or well digested the many circumstances which plead in my favour; but having done this, I am mistaken indeed, if your heart is not too expanded to sully me with reproach afterwards. My own conscience acquits me from having acted wrong; next to that, I wish for the approbation of my friends, and after them, the charitable construction of the world. I know you wish me happy, and no woman can be more so than I am at present, with every expectation of a continuance. (210) As the opening of her narrative indicates, her first marriage to Alexander had also followed a brief engagement: “being conscious of meriting the reproaches of my friends and relations, for having hastily married as I did contrary to their wishes, and am determined rather than be an incumbrance on them, to accompany my husband even to the wilds of Africa” (9). The “wilds of Africa” are offered as a place to accommodate her wild conduct, and rather than hiding underDomesticating the Colony 141 the "banners of Hymen,” she seems to boldly wave them in public view. Like the West Indies, West Africa is constructed as a place of sexual disorder. But disorder is manageable, if not by the governors of the colony, then by women writers. Her presentation of her second marriage discloses a concern about rhetorical “modesty": she would not want her corpus of letters to be accused of textual promiscuity. Falconbridge assures her reader that an explanation of her romantic activity will protect her from being "sullied.” Her implication is that the right narratives of dramatized femininity are panaceas for social transgression. A female narrator can escape the mark of personal vice if stories of "sullied” behavior are translated into instructive narrative. Thus can domesticity contain the dangers colonial settings pose to the English. The dramatization of her domestic concerns extends to important political affairs in the colony. In Falconbridge's eighth letter, written upon her return to London by slave ship via Jamaica, she engages in a very curious discussion of slavery that is inadequately addressed in any of the critical material on her. In a remarkable turn, she justifies the slave trade, based primarily upon her voyage on the slave ship and her assessment of the middle passage, but influenced by her domestic situation. After detailing the "contente[d] and satisfie[d]" (233) reaction of the slaves to their abduction, she writes the following unabashed recantation of her former position: For a length of time I viewed the Slave Trade with abhorrence - considering it a blemish on every civilized nation that countenanced or supported it, and that this, our happy enlightened country was more especially stigmatized for carrying it on, than any other; but I am not ashamed to confess, those sentiments were the effect of ignorance, and the142 Adventures in Domesticity prejudice of opinion, imbibed by associating with a circle of acquaintances, bigoted for the abolition, before I had acquired information enough to form any independent thoughts up on the subject, and so widely opposite are my ideas of the trade from what they were, that I now think it in no shape objectionable either to morality or religion. (235) Aware of how surprising her claims would be, she prevaricates briefly, cautioning the reader: "Pray do not misinterpret my arguments, and suppose me a friend to slavery, or wholly an enemy to abolishing the Slave Trade; least you should, I must explain myself" (238). She then invokes arguments similar to those outlined in the oft-read book written in support of the slave trade: Lt. John Matthews's Voyage to the Two Rivers of Sierra Leone in 1785 and 1786, whom Falconbridge thrice cites as an authority on the natural history of the country (Falconbridge vi, 146, 162). Matthews's narrative, an Enlightenment-based, empire-building text, lauds mercantilism as the practice on which British economy and luxury rest. Several of Matthews's by-then commonplace arguments are visible in Falconbridge's five-page defense of the trade. Matthews claims that Britain has no way of stopping the intestine wars on the African coast, where war captives are often enslaved, and thereby exculpates Britain from the responsibility of perpetuating an already on going traffic in humans. He also claims that slaves are rescued from subjection to unsavory practices in which certain countries engage in to deal with overpopulation. He pleads slavery's "humane" case: thousands of people are rescued from death and are "thus made useful members of society" (183). This Foucauldian ending, where slavery is justified as a human practice productive of "docile bodies" useful to both states (Foucault 135, passim), is foundational in the ideology ofDomesticating the Colony 143 empire, and would have been familiar to Falconbridge, though she rejects the typical argument that English slavers merely capitalized on ongoing intestine wars: I have frequently heard wars were common among the natives for the purpose of obtaining slaves; such may have been the practice, but I have enquired of several Chiefs, who positively deny it; and I am certain, since my first acquaintance in this part of the world, none of those predatory wars have happened hereabouts, notwithstanding upwards of two thousand slaves have been shipped and sent to the West Indies, from this river, within these last twelve months. (193) Lastly, both writers anticipate nineteenth-century American proslavery writers who claim that the slave owners' financial interest in the slave preclude them from inflicting harm, and that the reciprocal affection the master and slave begin to feel for one another ensures a familial, almost domestic, and efficient labor community. Falconbridge's late support of the slave trade employs similar rhetoric, arguing that Christian morality and affection will prevent slave owners from inflicting abuses on their property. And she too falls back on a Hobbesian view of the world that establishes hierarchies as necessary. But she remains cautious in her defense, and ends the narrative thus: "I am heartily glad to get rid of this subject, and am surprised how I came to entangle myself in it: but trust not expressions have slipped from me which will reproach my humanity or sensibility, for the wrongs of mankind" (239-40). Although the discourse of abolition had already feminized such terms as humanity and sensibility, women writers on both sides of the slave debate subscribed to similar rhetorical strategies of144 Adventures in Domesticity dramatizing femininity as a way to articulate political concerns. Though Falconbridge takes up the cause of economic and social restitution for the residents of Freetown, we are left speculating about the motives for her journey into the rhetoric of proslavery travel writers. It is possible to view her position as one borne out of extensive and extended frustration with the Sierra Leone Company and with the personal difficulties she underwent with her abolitionist husband. When Falconbridge first arrives in Sierra Leone, the French gentlemen slave traders provide her with the ballast necessary to keep her from emotional shipwreck. They literally offer her shelter from the "floating cage” (24) of the Lapwing Cutter, an offer refused by her husband, who is averse to socializing with slavers and prefers to stay on the inhospitable ship (22). She also recounts several secret excursions with French "factory owners,” narrated as if to make more poignant the ungentlemanly conduct of her husband. While Alexander Falconbridge “is naturally of an irritable disposition" (57), the French slave traders she met upon her arrival in the colony were kind and generous to her: “I must be wanting in sensibility, if my heart did not warm with gratitude to Messrs. Ballingall and Tilly, for their kindnesses to me” (24-25). These personal kindnesses, coupled with her growing aversion to the avarice and mismanagement of the directors of the Sierra Leone Company, could explain why she would have some impulse to defend the culture and organization of the slave trade and its traders. While she will not betray her loyalty to the tenets of the abolitionist movement – she never wavers about certain fundamental humanist rights of Africans - she does acknowledge that the abolitionist movement is flawed and that it has disobliged her personally. That personal obligation crosses so intimately with political debt testifies to the relation between the domestic realm and colonialism. While travel to the West Indies andDomesticating the Colony 145 Africa may have opened up literary and political opportunities for white Englishwomen, their travel narratives often legitimized a hierarchy of culture and womanhood by perpetuating divisions between and among African, Afro- Caribbean, Creole, and white English women. Such divisions, as I will argue in the next chapter, depended upon social categories determined by the role of sexual, reproductive, and physical labor. In the preceding three chapters, I have endeavored to examine the impact of colonial travel on changing representations of domesticity and cultural others. In dramatizing domesticity, literary texts and other modes of discourse, such as travel narratives, reflect England's anxiety that social, sexual, and narrative adulteration would result from cultural mixing. Such fears most often were consolidated onto the figure of the female. However, because women travel writers confronted the gendered premises of imperialism by complicating the feminization of the social ills of empire and, more broadly, by dramatizing domesticity, their narratives reorganized colonial discourse. In these and other ways, women's travel writing intersected with other modes of discourse to negotiate the role of women within colonialism. The next chapter extends this argument, claiming that Jane Austen's novel Mansfield Park endorses imperial and patriarchal values by representing as dangerous and contaminating cultural others whose difference is determined by the kinds of labor women perform. Notes Her description reflects what Sara Mills calls “a range of power nexuses” within which women travelers narrate their experiences. Falconbridge negotiates both “the power of patriarchy which acted upon them as middle-class women, through discourses of femininity: and the power of colonialism which acted upon them in relation to the people of the countries they describe in their books.” Sara Mills, Discourses146 Adventures in Domesticity of Difference (New York: Routledge, 1991), 18. These women are not colonized women per se, but they bear social similarity to colonized African women because of their status and because their sexual activity, both as prostitutes and as sexual partners to black men, has temporarily removed them from the bourgeois realm of virtuous womanhood. 2 As Felicity Nussbaum, Torrid Zones: Materinity, Sexuality, and Empire in Eighteenth-Century English Narratives (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1995), points out, bourgeois female sexuality depended upon the construction of the lower-class prostitute body as (ironically) barren (only virtuous women can produce useful subjects) and as a threat to trade and national identity (97, 99, 100). 3 See Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar's The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1979), Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger: An Analysis of the Concepts of Pollution and Taboo (New York: Routledge, 1966), Mary Poovey, Making a Social Body: British Cultural Formation, 1830-1864 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995), Judith Butler, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (New York: Routledge, 1990), R.

Srinivas Aravamudan's chapter, “Equiano and the Politics of Literacy” in Tropicopolitans: Colonialism and Agency, 1688-1804 (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1999) deals with both Equiano and Falconbridge. Falconbridge must have known that there was a lucrative market for travel narratives and natural histories. In a private letter from John Clarkson to his brother Thomas in January 1792, he advises him to keep a natural history and journal: “The reason for the last advice is this. Every body is curious of reading Histories of new Countries, This is the Taste of the Age — and, if you get a good History of All the particulars, I will get you 500 (pounds] for it, whenever you return” (British Museum Manuscripts: John Clarkson's correspondence, vol. 1, p. 65). Since nearly every member of the Council wrote a history of Sierra Leone, and since travel writing was widely popular, Anna Maria Falconbridge could be presumed to know of the pecuniary value her text was likely to command. All quotations from letters to and from theDomesticating the Colony 149 Clarkson brothers and Dubois are my transcriptions of handwritten letters collected in the British Museum's Manuscript room. (In 1998, they were catalogued under Additional MS 41, 262, but they are likely to have been moved to the British Library in the fall of 1998, and may have been assigned a different location and number. Dubois's journal has since been published by Christopher Fyfe as an appendix to A.M. Falconbridge's Narrative [Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2000]) J. Clarkson to I. Dubois, July 1793, vol. 3, p. 55, Clarkson correspondence, British Museum manuscripts. Since John Clarkson was believed to have personal influence over Alexander, it became his job to intervene in what the Company saw as Alexander Falconbridge's relationship with local Sierra Leonean kings: “Another thing is the Company are almost at present with 150,000 (pounds] Capital in Falconbridges Power, because he alone is known to Kind Naimbana and his Secretary Elliote. He has first brought them over to the Companys Interest, and were he disposed, could turn them perhaps against it. Now it will be your principal or at least particular study to create an Interest with the different kings but with Naimbainna in particular. This you know much better how to do than I can tell you — By a system of Justice, Candour, Openness, Willingness to inform, instruct, and assist, frequenth visit and invitation; in fact you must ingratiate yourself with Naimbianna & his secretary Elliote, and here let me add that the King seldom does anything without Elliott's Consent: Elliott is much indebted to Wm Sharp, and a Knowledge (unclear word] you are related to Mr Sharp may avail you. Elliott too is a reasonable man — make him a Confidante — he will comprehend all your schemes of benevolence when Niambainna cannot. Assure him that the great object of the Company is 'The Happiness & Civilization150 Adventures in Domesticity of the Natives' Consult him in many of your plans — Invite him to your Home. I question whether Elliott has not more Influence than Naimbainna himself. In fine do everything proper to make an Interest with the Kings and Elliott so that you shall at all times have more Influence with them than Falconbridge: first, because you will make a better use of it; and secondly because, in proportion as your Influence increases that of Falconbridge will decline. This is in fact what the Company wish: for it would be a pity that the noble Object of our Institution should be hazarded by the Impetuosity and warmth of temper of an individual, or that we, with so large a Capital should be wholly at his mercy” (Clarkson Papers, vol. 1, p. 66 British Museum, Manuscripts, Additional MS 41, 262 A). Mackenzie-Grieve describes this lacuna as a gendered phenomenon, calling Falconbridge's omissions a “lack of the feminine tendency to individualize” (37). This also contradicts the majority of criticism about women's autobiographical and travel writing, which differentiates women's writing from men's based upon the more frequent use of first-person narration and confession. Edward Long, “Candid Reflections Upon the Judgement lately awarded by the Court of King's Bench ... On What is Commonly Called the Negro Cause, by a Planter" (London 1772), 48-49, cited by Peter Freyer, Staying Power (London: Pluto Press, 1984), 157-58. Long's pamphlet responded to the Somerset case which judged blacks free once they were on English soil. The ruling was rarely obeyed. See Robert Young's Colonial Desire: Hybridity in Theory, Culture and Race (New York: Routledge, 1995) on hybridity. His scholarship on nineteenth-century scientific racism deftly points out the force of concepts likeDomesticating the Colony 151 “adulteration” and “cultivation” to the development of ideas like nationalism and civilization in England. See especially his chapter, “Sex and Inequality: The Cultural Construction of Race." 14 Debbie Lee makes an interesting related argument in her article “Yellow Fever and the Slave Trade: Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” ELH 65.3 (1998). 18 See Poovey, Making a Social Body, chapter 3, “Curing the Social Body in 1832: James Phillips Kay and the Irish in Manchester.” © The conjunction between disembodied and sentimental is a strange one since it was the goal of sentimental fiction to produce somatic responses in readers. Materially, women exercised political muscle by waging campaigns to abstain from consumption of products imported from colonial plantations. See Charlotte Sussman, “Women and the Politics of Sugar, 1792” Representations 48 (Fall 94), and Sidney Mintz, Sweetness and Power (New York: Viking, 1985). o As Sussman's work on abolition campaigns and sugar has noted, public sentiment about sugar consumption “linked colonial sites of the production of raw materials with the domestic sites of their consumption,” revealing “the crucial role played by constructions of female virtue in articulating the relationship between Britain and its West Indian colonies” ("Women and the Politics of Sugar” 48). While Shaw makes no abolitionist assertions, she instead suggests broadening women's participation in the sociopolitical activities of empire: women ought to internalize colonial ideology by ingesting its152 Adventures in Domesticity products. Janet Shaw, Journal of a lady of quality (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1921). 19 While she locates herself in a feminine position, she is an empowered speaking subject, and we, as readers, must note that, as Ferguson puts it, “Anti-slavery discourse ... played a significant role in generating and consolidating nineteenth- century British imperialist and 'domestic-racist' ideology" (Subject to Others 6). In the next chapter, I elaborate on the trope of blood corruption. For a cogent discussion of the intersection between blood corruption and generic corruption, see William Epstein, Recognizing Biography (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1987), 6-9, and chapter 5 especially. 21 Though eighteenth-century women writers worked within a dialectic of gender difference, they were often able to practice forms of strategic textual essentialism that would let them go places with their writing. The currency of natural female virtues was everywhere visible in fiction; Jane Austen's epistolary novella, Lady Susan, written around 1795 (but not published until after Austen's death in 1817) scripts a character who "is able to manipulate others chiefly because she knows that the use of language is an art capable of generating plausible, internally consistent, but wholly malleable fictions - just as the manners of propriety can” (Poovey, Making a Social Body, 175). Falconbridge would not have engaged in the kind of stylized femininity Lady Susan did, but as Nussbaum, Torrid Zones, has pointed out in her work on women's autobiography, women risked getting “caught in mimicking the dominant ideologies of themselves,” but could often subvert those ideologies. Falconbridge manipulated "natural" virtues so artfully that by the end of her narrative, sheDomesticating the Colony 153 is able to wax indignant to Members of Parliament, with impunity. 2 Luce Irigaray, This Sex Which Is Not One, trans. Catherine Porter (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1985). She writes: “One must assume the feminine role deliberately. Which means already to convert a form of subordination into an affirmation, and thus to begin to thwart it" (76). Specifically, "It means to resubmit herself ... to ideas about herself, that are elaborated in/by a masculine logic, ... so as to make visible, by an effect of playful repetition, what was supposed to remain invisible" (76). 23 2. During the time Falconbridge wrote her narrative, gothic connoted “rude” and “barbarous” (OED), and still had ties to Teutonic or Germanic government and culture. Her use of gothic is thus most similar to a later description of the Sierra Leone directors' behavior as “ridiculously despotic.” She makes the prostitutes' sexuality and cultural identity a national problem by blaming England for their condition, and by instructing her readers to respond with sympathetic indignation. For twentieth-century readers, her description of the government's activities as “gothic” invokes a familiar literary genre notable for dangerous landscapes and the loss of female virtue. Made popular by Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho, Matthew Lewis's The Monk, and Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, gothic fiction was considered overly sensate and was negatively compared with a tradition of rational fiction and domestic plots. Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey, for instance, warned against the dangers of gothic fiction to the education of impressionable girls who could end up with unrealistic ideas about the world that would, by virtue of failing to be a woman of sense, compromise their success in the marriage market.154 Adventures in Domesticity 24 This bears a marked similarity to Lady Mary Wortly Montagu's descriptions in her Turkish Embassy Letters. She claims that the veil affords women sexual mobility, since the veil serves as a mask of their identity that enables them to go where they wish in secret. On 1 April 1717, she wrote to Lady Mar from Adrianople. Since her remarks on the “Turkish ladies,” are both fitting and highly engaging, I quote at length: 'Tis very easy to see they have more liberty than we have, no woman of what rank soever being permitted to go in the streets without two muslins, one that covers her face all but her eyes and another that hides the whole dress of her head and hangs half-way down her back; ... This perpetual masquerade gives them entire liberty of following their inclinations without danger of discovery. The move usual method of intrigue is to send an appointment to the lover to meet the lady at a Jew's shop, which are as notoriously convenient as our Indian houses, ... The great ladies seldom let their gallants know who they are, and 'tis so difficult to find it out that they can very seldom guess at her name they have corresponded with above half a year together. You may easily imagine the number of faithful wives very small. (96-97) 23 Anne McClintock argues this point in Imperial Leather: Gender, Race, and Sexuality in the Colonial Context (New York: Routledge, 1995). See her chapter titled "The Lay of the Land: Genealogies and Imperialism.” She writes: “The idea of 'racial purity,' for example, depends on the rigorous policing of women's sexuality; as an historical notion, then, racial “purity' is inextricably implicated in the dynamics ofDomesticating the Colony 155 gender and cannot be understood without a theory of gender power" (61). 20 In a brief description of her first social meal on Antigua, Shaw describes gender difference in relation to consumption. It is a scene where she advocates intemperance as a virtue: I observed the young Ladies drank nothing but Lime-juice and water. They told me it was all the women drank in general. Our good landlady strongly advised us not to follow so bad an example — that Madeira and water would do no body harm, and that it was owing to their method of living, that they were such spiritless and indolent creatures. The ladies smiling replied that the men indeed said so, but it was custom and every body did it in spite of the advices they were daily getting. What a tyrant is custom in every part of the world. The poor women, whose spirits must be worn out by heat and constant perspiration, require no doubt some restorative, yet as it is not the custom, they will faint under it rather than transgress this ideal law. I will however follow our good Landlady's advice, and as I was resolved to shew I was to be a rebel to a custom that did not appear founded on reason, I pledged her in a bumper of the best Madeira I ever tasted. (80- 81) Representing herself as amusingly intrepid, Shaw's use of the language of domination (tyrant, rebel) to describe her act of social defiance points to several displacements. She displaces a discussion of slavery, colonial trade, and an explicit confrontation with the conflation of women and the trope of156 Adventures in Domesticity disease by a description of the social conventions of polite West Indian society. But she is absolutely aware of the political implications of such conventions. Here she develops her opinion of the social logic of drink: They drink only green Tea and that remarkably fine; their Coffee and chocolate too are uncommonly good; their sugar is monstrously dear, never under three shillings per pound. At this you will not wonder when you are told, they use none but what returns from England double refined, and has gone thro' all the duties. I believe this they are forced to by act of parliament, but am not certain. This however is a piece of great extravagance, because the sugar here can be refined into the most transparent sirup and tastes fully as well as the double refined Sugar, and is certainly much more wholesome. Many of the Ladies use it for the Coffee and all for the punch. The drink which I have seen every where is Punch, Madeira, Port and Claret; in some places, particularly at Mr Halliday's, they have also Burgendy (sic). Bristol beer and porter you constantly find, but they have not yet been able to have Champaign [sic), as the heat makes it fly too much. They have cyder from America very good." (99-100) In laying out the commercial relationship between the colonies, she politicizes her exhortation to white Creole women to drink certain beverages customarily reserved for men. Having toured the slave plantations — and having made several stereotypically disturbing observations that sentimentalize (and Elizabeth Bohls, Women Travel Writers and the Language of Aesthetics, 1716–1818 New York: Cambridge UniversityDomesticating the Colony 157 Press, 1995) says that aestheticize) slavery, she is aware of the origin of sugar. As Sussman's work on abolition campaigns and sugar has noted, public sentiment about sugar consumption "linked colonial sites of the production of raw materials with the domestic sites of their consumption,” revealing "the crucial role played by constructions of female virtue in articulating the relationship between Britain and its West Indian colonies” ("Women and the Politics of Sugar” 48). Brown writes about women ingesting colonial ideology in her analysis of Pope's poem, “The Rape of the Lock.” See Ends of Empire, 144-46. See also Sussman's “Women and the Politics of Sugar” for a discussion of domestic consumption of colonial goods as it relates to colonial ideology. 20 See Pratt, Imperial Eyes, chapters 3 “Narrating the Anti-Conquest” and 4, “Anti-Conquest II: The Mystique of Reciprocity.” All citations are from my personal transcription of his handwritten narrative which in 1998 was located in the British Museum Manuscript room, but by publication of this book should be housed in the British Library. 30 Equally as curious as Falconbridge's political vacillation is the question of why the critical history on Falconbridge would turn a blind eye to the defense of the slave trade embedded in her narrative. Ferguson's Subject to Others analyzes Falconbridge's text as an abolitionist document. While Ferguson acknowledges that Falconbridge “barely legitimizes colonialism; [and] ... throws the 'civilizing mission' distinctly into question” (207), she omits the passages that deal explicitly with the slave trade, as if wanting to maintain the integrity of abolitionist writers, even at the expense of fully exploring internal contradictions of their texts.158 Adventures in Domesticity Ferguson closes her otherwise astute discussion of Falconbridge by saying that the narrative "produces hitherto unknown knowledge about Africans, understandably fashioned according to a Eurocentric perspective” (208). In spite of Ferguson's discussion of the "domestic-racist ideology” of the abolitionist movement (6), we are left wondering if this might be an instance where the critical history of nineteenth-century feminism, bound strongly to the abolitionist tradition, was concerned with its own sense of critical decorum. Pratt's sharp critique of Falconbridge locates her within a tradition of sentimental travel writing, and only fleetingly mentions Falconbridge's political change, which is framed by “the erotic and the domestic” (Pratt, Imperial Eyes, 105). But Pratt does not try to unravel it. She describes Falconbridge's behavior after her husband has died: She quickly finds herself a new mate in the colony. So echoes of late eighteenth-century feminism make their way to the contact zone, paradoxically in the context of a pro-slavery tract! In her closing pages Falconbridge declares that having "acquired information enough to form independent thoughts upon the subject,” she now views slavery "in no shape objectionable either to morality or religion.” (105) But these are at least fifty pages away from being the closing pages, and Falconbridge's position is not so uncomplicated.Chapter 4 “A great deal better employed doing nothing": The Role of Female Labor and the Danger of Difference in Jane Austen's Mansfield Park When, in the middle of Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, Fanny Price refuses Henry Crawford's socially advantageous marriage proposal, her guardian uncle, Sir Thomas, sends her back to her parents' home in Portsmouth for an indefinite visit. It is one of a number of instances in which Austen uses travel as a means of navigating a dangerous domestic terrain. Meant as no pleasure tour, Fanny's trip is to be a journey through social stations, one designed to quell her rebellious behavior and to reinforce Sir Thomas's rule over the sexual capital of the women under his control: his prime motive in sending her away, had very little to do with the propriety of her seeing her parents again, and nothing at all with any idea of making her happy. He certainly wished her to go willingly, but he as certainly wished her to be heartily sick of home before her visit ended; and that a little abstinence from the elegancies and luxuries of Mansfield Park, would bring her mind into a sober state, and incline her to a juster estimate of the value of that home of greater permanence, and equal comfort, of160 Adventures in Domesticity which she had the offer. It was a medicinal project upon his niece's understanding, which he must consider as at present diseased. (335) Fanny's disease is defiant sexuality, a threat to Sir Thomas's world of patriarchs and plantocrats. Just as Sir Thomas, earlier in the novel, had been called to Antigua to manage the affairs on his sugar plantation, now he is called upon to manage the social ills of his English country estate. His corrective to the ailing social body will be a grim reminder that Fanny may possess rebellious blood, but Sir Thomas will flex the necessary muscle to set the social body to rights. Eighteenth-century writers of fiction, travelogues, and social history often presented race and miscegenation via the same tropes Austen uses to figure class in Mansfield Park: disease and adulteration. As Robert Young notes, the trope of adulteration and the trope of cultivation form the ideological bridge between England's definition of civilization and race and class difference: As the defining feature of whiteness, civilization merged with its quasi-synonym "cultivation,” and thus the scale of difference which separated the white from the other races was quickly extended so that culture became the defining feature of the upper and middle classes. It thus marked out their differences from the working classes. (95) Early in the eighteenth century, Daniel Defoe's female grifters, like Moll or Roxana, cashed in on their ability to manipulate the appearance of cultivation. By the end of the century, fictional protagonists are no longer appreciated for such survival skills. Rather, characters like Austen's Fanny must be cultivated out of their class or race culture in order to enable“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 161 the marriage that is crucial to the novel's social order. This fantasy of assimilation replaces the narratives of foreign conquest and colonial masquerade that proliferated at the beginning of the eighteenth century. The new adventure tale is now a narrative of domestic travel and cultivation – one where anxieties about labor and difference are incorporated into domestic plots that confront indirectly the forces that are reshaping English life. Sir Thomas is concerned with just such minglings when he imports his lower-class niece to his estate at Mansfield: “There will be some difficulty in our way, Mrs. Norris,” observed Sir Thomas, “as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they group up; how to preserve in the minds of my daughters the consciousness of what they are, without making them think too lowly of their cousin; and how, without depressing her spirits too far, to make her remember that she is not a Miss Bertram ... they cannot be equals. Their rank, fortune, rights, and expectations, will always be different.” (8) Thus, within an ideology of domesticity, it is not just “the idea of racial 'purity,' [that] depends on the rigorous policing of women's sexuality,” as Anne McClintock notes, but also that of “distinctions" within rank or class (61). A member of both the rising colonial plantocracy and the traditional English squirearchy, Sir Thomas projects his fear of racial miscegenation on one side of the Atlantic onto his anxieties about class intermingling on the other. Such fears of class and racial crossing were common among the plantocracy. Witness plantation owner Edward Long's paranoid response to the 1772 Somerset162 Adventures in Domesticity decision which, as we know, legally (but not in practice) declared blacks free once on English soil: The lower class of women in England, are remarkably fond of the blacks, for reasons too brutal to mention; they would connect themselves with horses and asses if the laws permitted them. By these ladies they generally have a numerous brood. Thus, in the course of a few generations more, the English blood will become so contaminated with this mixture, and from the chances, the ups and downs of life, this alloy may spread so extensively, as even to reach the middle, and then the higher orders of the people, till the whole nation resembles the Portuguese and Moriscos in complexion of skin and baseness of mind. This is a venomous and dangerous ulcer, that threatens to disperse its malignancy far and wide, until every family catches infection from it. (484-9) This language of infection, disease, and fear that, as we have seen, Austen also uses in Mansfield Park to describe challenges to patriarchal authority, swivels into what Robert Young calls “colonial desire": "[A] desiring machine, with its unlimited appetite for territorial expansion, for 'endless growth and self-reproduction', for making connections and disjunctions, continuously forced disparate territories, histories and people to be thrust together like foreign bodies in the night. In that sense it was itself the instrument that produced its own darkest fantasy – the unlimited and ungovernable fertility of ‘unnatural' unions.” Colonial plantations were spaces of eroticized production that attracted prurient and economic interest and repulsed traditional ideas of domestic virtue. As we shall see, Sir Thomas's "darkest fantasy” is that, in his“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 163 English plantation at Mansfield Park, his cultivation of Fanny in close proximity to his sons will foster a mutual attraction. It is unsurprising that Austen's presentation of class parallels racial discourse since, as Long's racist diatribe illustrates, late-eighteenth-century political and social theorists' fears of blacks and the poor bore a striking resemblance to one another. Indeed, racial taboos were absolutely intertwined with class distinctions in the discourse of the period. Young claims that “racialized class differentiation” was a particularly salient feature of early-nineteenth-century culture, for it "fantasized intrinsic qualities of class during a period when it was patently evident that you could simply buy your way into the middle and upper classes if you had the cash” (95, 96). This was especially pertinent during the turn of the century when colonial wealth (such as Sir Thomas's sugar trade in Mansfield Park) or naval careers built in part on colonial trade (such as Wentworth's in Persuasion) could enable rapid and dramatic social mobility, rendering England's class system perhaps more fluid than it had been for centuries. James Thompson is right to claim that Mansfield Park "represents Austen's clearest expression of class conflict; for her, the upper-middle class or gentry is systematically defended by rejecting, on the one side, the vulgar or undeserving lower classes,” portrayed by Fanny's Portsmouth sailor family, “as well as rejecting, or at least correcting, the decadent upper class on the other” (39). The novel everywhere articulates the fear that Fanny will marry her first cousin, Edmund, legitimizing the endogamous desire that infiltrates the estate from the moment she arrives at Mansfield Park. At the same time, of course, the reader is engaged in a sustained wish for the union Sir Thomas is so eager to prevent. Although their coupling threatens to infect the family's bloodline with lower- class vices, it is also the remedy to the moral disease of domestic bodies dangerously out of control. The importation and cultivation of Fanny from Portsmouth drudge to gentrified164 Adventures in Domesticity lady is a fantasy of voluntary submission to patriarchal dominion in the English countryside, a fantasy that resolves fear through a plot of assimilation in which cultural difference is effaced and replaced by tales of traditional order, as when Sir Thomas regales his family with stories of Antigua until their “whole comprehension (was) filled by his narratives” (161). Fanny's triumphant return to Mansfield Park as Edmund's future wife is thus a forceful endorsement of both patriarchal and imperial values that are based upon an ideology that fears the contaminating vices of cultural others and is supported by a class-and-race-based ideology that is defined preeminently by the role of female labor. In what follows, I will argue that Austen's endorsement of the remarkable debility of Fanny Price over the dangerous sexual vitality of Mary Crawford in Mansfield Park traces a plot of bourgeois domestic virtue that instantiates the signifying value of female labor as one of the ways in which the ideologies of patriarchy and imperialism intersect through gender difference." Mansfield Park differs from Austen's other novels most notably in her portrayal of women and physical vigor. In Pride and Prejudice, Elizabeth Bennett's emotional and physical pluck is celebrated as a defiance of class snobbery and is meant as a rebuke to the failure of aristocratic culture to set a good moral example for the rest of English society. Her physical vigor parallels the moral virtue that will revitalize the aristocracy when she marries Fitzwilliam Darcy. Mrs. Croft's hearty stand-by-your-man character makes her praiseworthy in Persuasion and, while Marianne's vigorous sensibility is represented as excessively romantic sentiment in Sense and Sensibility, the moral rectitude of Elinor's complementary sense is certainly more robust than anything Fanny Price can muster. Thus the belabored debility of Fanny Price, Jane Austen's most unusual and least charismatic heroine, sets“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 165 Mansfield Park apart from Austen's other fiction. In all of Austen's novels, the patriarch is absent or compromised, and the patriarchal estate is disrupted. But in Mansfield Park the novel's resolution depends upon Fanny's marriage to Edmund, and the estate and patriarchal order are rescued by the virtue of Fanny's enduring inactivity. While physical labor tires her, Fanny performs intangible moral labor that serves the interests of patriarchy. Thus Fanny eventually emerges as the natural heiress not only because her weakness in bodily strength is complemented by her meekness (her moral delicacy), but also because her repeated exercise of personal, self-directed pleasure can be read as a threat to patriarchal authority that can be best managed through assimilation. Mary and Fanny's contest for the affections of Sir Thomas's second son, Edmund, is emblematic of larger social forces that were reshaping the cultural landscape of England. Mansfield Park represents these kinds of worldly affairs as dangerous excesses that threaten to encroach upon the ordered world of the English countryside. More specifically, the threat of disorder at Sir Thomas's slave plantation, Henry Crawford's transgressive desires (which Austen calls the “riot of ... untasted pleasure,” or “the freaks of a cold-blooded vanity'), and ungovernable female sexuality must be incorporated into the narrative of domestic fiction so that they can be rendered manageable (111, 426). Both colonial and patriarchal logic elevated white European women to a position of disembodied virtue that was countered by and made possible by the degradation of African, West Indian, and working-class English women as excessively sexualized and physically vigorous. Like many novelists and social theorists of her time, Austen portrays labor and vigorous, laboring bodies as both gendered and dangerous, as multiple sources of anxiety that intersect with one another. Fanny embodies these displaced fears. Nearly every Austen critic has questioned why, unlike her other novels, Austen166 Adventures in Domesticity cultivated a heroine best described as a wilted flower. Indeed, Fanny is fatigued merely by picking roses and walking half a mile (65). But, in Mansfield Park's domestic relations, vigor is feared; it threatens to burgeon into dangerous excesses like immoral acting, inappropriate gaiety (111, 143), and at worst, adultery – especially in the absence of the patriarch's management. The narrative diffuses such dangers by incorporating them into the plot of bourgeois domestic virtue, which endorses the interests of patriarchy and imperialism by depicting women's sexuality and physical vigor as dangerous. Austen was certainly aware of the Enlightenment tradition of "gauging the quality of a civilization by the way that women were treated within it.” She seems to advocate, as Tony Tanner suggests, "the intimate and significant connection between [Fanny's] virtue and her immobility” (143). Like social theorists who claimed that the cultures of Africa and the English laboring poor were degraded because their women worked, Austen implies that Fanny's debility is an apt index of her moral exultation. Starting in the eighteenth century, the relationship between female sexuality and labor became central to the definition of cultural difference. Many late-eighteenth-century travel narratives and natural histories were organized around a series of proto-anthropological “descriptions” of exotic others and included sections on sexual practices that were often based upon labor. Thomas Winterbottom, Edinburgh University- trained physician to the Sierra Leone Company, in his Account of the Native Africans in the Neighbourhood of Sierra Leone (1803), offers a concise example of the common practice of linking descriptions of sexuality to labor practices. In chapter 9, “Situation of Women. Marriages. Polygamy. Population. Period of Child Bearing. Names of Men and Women," he opens with a claim that would have been familiar to eighteenth-century readers:“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 167 The female sex does not hold in Africa that distinguished rank in society which it happily enjoys in Europe; a circumstance which will not excite surprise, as it occurs among all rude and uncivilized nations. Montesquieu says, that the existence of a money medium is a certain mark of civilization; but it will probably be found a less fallible criterion, to judge by the degree of respect in which women are held .... Women are in a state of degradation; all the menial offices, and some of the most laborious kind, fall to their lot. (144) Travel writer Anna Maria Falconbridge follows this tradition of assessing cultural difference and cultural worth based upon women's physical labor and parturition: The women are not nigh so well shaped as the men, being employed in all hard labour, makes them robust and clumsy; they are very prolific, and keep their breasts always suspended, which, after bearing a child or two, stretches out to an enormous length; disgusting to Europeans, though considered beautiful and ornamental here. They are not only obliged to till the ground, and do all laborious work, but are kept at a great distance by the men, who seldom suffer a woman to sit down or eat with them. (77) Natural historians and travel writers, no matter what side of the slavery debate they espoused, often claimed that the “lascivious" sexual practices of Africans and black West Indians, coupled with women's participation in agricultural labor were evidence of their uncivilized social organization.168 Adventures in Domesticity Long's disturbing descriptions of Africans, West Indians, and Creoles in his History of Jamaica also tie marriage to labor, asserting that women in polygamous marriages, although called wives, are only a sort of occasional concubines, or drudges, whose assistance the husband claims in the culture of his land, sale of his produce, and so on” (bk. 3, ch. 1, 380). The language recalls Defoe's warning that women who toil away their lives in bad marriages endure a subordination to their husbands equivalent to that of an upper servant who lives a life of drudgery. Thus reproductive labor was equally as important as physical labor in determining cultural difference. Indeed, until nationalist fervor heated up at the end of the eighteenth century, English women were encouraged to farm out their babies to lower-class wet nurses, whose poverty guaranteed their physical sturdiness. Similarly, women's ability to labor in fields indicated their constitutional sturdiness – in this context, a sign of masculinity. Civilization was to be measured not only by a position of women within a labor economy, but also by standards of femininity based upon physical characteristics and reproductive practices. Long writes of West Indian blacks: “Their women are delivered with little or no labour; they have therefore no more occasion for midwives, than the female oran-outang, or any other wild animal” (bk 3. ch 1. 380). Fanny's mother is derogated from the outset of Mansfield Park for what is described as her excessive reproductive and physical labor. She is at once evocative of the supposedly overly sexed women of Africa and the West Indies and of Defoe's English married drudge, no better than an upper servant who must toil in her own home. The novel opens with Fanny's voyage to Mansfield Park, a trip necessitated by her mother's reproductive forces, which are portrayed as excessive to the point of near-monstrosity. Mrs. Price's family is “large and still increasing," a description suggestive of permanent and infinite unwieldiness. She“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 169 “bewails the circumstance” of “her ninth lying-in," adding to her "superfluity of children” (3). Fanny is not the first to be considered eligible for import to Mansfield Park; Mrs. Price offers her eldest son, "a fine spirited fellow who longed to be out in the world . .. Was there any chance of his being hereafter useful to Sir Thomas in the concerns of his West Indian property?” (3). The first proposed remedy to Mrs. Price's fecundity, then, is not domestic travel (a change in social circumstances by avuncular adoption) but colonial travel. This is consistent with the logic of imperialism, which defined the West Indies as a notorious site of sexual excess. Austen depicts Antigua as a receptacle for managing the excesses of England, specifically, for the excess female sexuality that exacerbated the breach between Lady Bertram, Mrs. Norris, and their lower-class sister. Sir Thomas also takes his eldest son to Antigua to “detach him from some bad connections at home” (28). The West Indies is thus used as a place to manage dangerous domestic affairs, usually of a sexual and pecuniary nature. The attempt to ship William to the West Indies is an attempt to convert Mrs. Price's reproductive labor into profitable labor. William could be "useful,” his mother suggests, at managing laboring bodies elsewhere, one instance of bodily excess profitably used to benefit the social body. Austen characteristically winks at the reader: “Poor woman! she probably thought change of air might agree with many of her children” (9). By engaging the reader in laughter, the comic force intends to establish an accepted norm of reproduction and a standard mode of living. But her wit does not counteract the fact that travel is used as a solution to an unmanageable problem of female sexual labor. The semantic correspondence between labor as work and labor as birth pains is oft-repeated and resonates importantly with its synonym: travail. Etymologically connected to travel, travail also signifies the pains of170 Adventures in Domesticity parturition, or labor. These semantic shadows reveal the relation between natural histories and novels in the formation of a gender-based ideology that divided up the world based upon cultures that labored and cultures that consumed. In the eighteenth century, then, a labor economy was a sexual economy, one based on cultural difference. Moreover, because female sexuality provided the safeguard against miscegenation and class intermingling, female virtue by extension had the power to defend traditional race and class- based hierarchies that had kept the gentry in their rural estates for so long. In Mansfield Park, Fanny is the class proxy for miscegenated Creole figures who, social theorists like Long believed, would usurp English estates from their rightful owners.' Miscegenation was depicted as a social evil; it was the forbidden intermingling of bodies that would result in dangerous cultural mixings and the dispersal of property to illegitimate children. In response to increased abolitionist activity following the Somerset case in 1772, planters published numerous tracts decrying the dangerous consequences of racial mingling. Barbados planter and Member of Parliament, Samuel Estwick, wrote of the need to “preserve the race of Britons from stain and contamination."8 Two years later, the London Chronicle published a letter that viewed miscegenation and abolitionist agitation as related elements of change that could only result in social mayhem: "our Colony Negroes (might be inspired] with endeavors to steal away from thence, in order to come into this land of liberty, though it be to starve, in vain hopes of washing the Blackamoor white. If not that effect, they may instil such enthusiastic notions of liberty, as may occasion revolutions in our colonies." The control of sexual behavior was popularly represented as necessary to racial purity and to the prevention of revolution, both of which menaced traditional social structures, such as clear lines of inheritance under patriarchy.“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 171 Thus both the problem and its prevention were articulated in terms of female (reproductive) labor." As McClintock puts it, “As an historical notion, then, racial 'purity' is inextricably implicated in the dynamics of gender and cannot be understood without a theory of gender power” (61). Where women are the subjects of patriarchy, they are also the agents of empire. The novel's economy of cultural difference was based not only upon race but also upon class." The use of female labor as a measure of one's social standing endured throughout the eighteenth century and into the nineteenth, as in this passage on poverty in Gloucester from William Cobbett's 1820's Rural Rides: “The labourers' dwellings, as I came along, looked good, and the labourers themselves pretty well as to dress and healthiness. The girls at work in the fields (always my standard) are not in rags, with bits of shoes tied on their feet and rags tied round their ankles, as they had in Wiltshire.”\Jane Austen, Raymond Williams points out, was “not far away, in another parsonage, ... beginning to write her novels of country society” during the time of Cobbett's observations (108)." In this light, Fanny appears as the figure of danger knocking at the border of Sir Thomas's narrative. The product of the kind of dangerous fecundity characteristic of both the lower classes and black West Indians, Fanny inhabits the Bertram estate as a domesticated version of the forbidden crossings feared by plantation owners contemporary with the fictitious Sir Thomas. Such a vision of elevated or degraded culture views bourgeois domesticity as an ideal of female passivity, an ideal that Laura Brown connects “to the devaluation of women's labor and the growth of female consumption” (20). Mrs. Price's marriage to a sailor reduced her to a lowly drudge. Indeed, the domestic labor required of a lower-class Portsmouth wife is what separates Mrs. Price from otherwise appearing as Lady Bertram's double:172 Adventures in Domesticity Of her two sisters, Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady Bertram than Mrs. Norris. She was a manager by necessity, without any of Mrs. Norris's inclination for it, or any of her activity. Her disposition was naturally easy and indolent, like Lady Bertram's; and a situation of similar affluence and do-nothing-ness would have been much more suited to her capacity, than the exertions and self-denials of the one, which her imprudent marriage had placed her in. She might have made just as good a woman of consequence as Lady Bertram. (355) The ideal of bourgeois English womanhood, neatly embodied in the sisters, values passive consumption over active production. Denigrated because she performs as much work as a female servant, Mrs. Price (Fanny's mother) is the complement to her sister, Lady Bertram, who is characterized by a near catatonic indolence. Of a particularly English aristocratic nature, Lady Bertram's indolence also marks her as the passive consumer Laura Brown sees as the new eighteenth- century feminine ideal.'4 Fanny's debility, on the other hand, makes her a kind of mediating figure for the convertible lower orders and the morally irresponsible upper orders. The novel cautions that revolutionary outcomes can result from female excesses like Lady Bertram's “pampered somnambulance," as Claudia Johnson puts it, Mary's puissance, the excess libidos of the Bertram girls, Mrs. Norris's officious malice, and even in certain respects, Fanny's debility itself." If the house at Mansfield Park is diseased, it is a female disease. It follows, then, that one of the morals of Mansfield Park is that the health of the English countryside depends upon the management of female bodies.“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing” 173 Austen's portrayal of active and sedentary bodies registers England's ambivalent relationship with labor and colonialism. Two of the novel's most dangerous (active) characters bear a disturbing resemblance to Creole types who both entice and threaten the Bertram family with immoral charisma. Henry and Mary Crawford are the siblings who open up the circle of acquaintance in the neighborhood of Mansfield Park, animating the sleepy village with their dangerously bold character. When Sir Thomas leaves Mansfield Park to attend to his plantations in Antigua, the Crawfords assume an intimate position at the house, threatening to infect the Bertram family with vices similar to those Sir Thomas has left to manage in the West Indies. Henry Crawford is said to have a complexion sufficiently dark as to be suspicious: he "was not handsome; no, when they first saw him, he was absolutely plain, black and plain, but still he was the gentleman, with a pleasing address" (39). Similarly, Miss Crawford is the dark complement to the two Bertram sisters, Fanny's foolish cousins whose “accomplishments” are achieved at the expense of "the less common acquirements of self-knowledge, generosity, and humility” (16). The Bertram sisters can appreciate Mary Crawford's beauty because her darkness is no competition with their own light-skinned appeal: Miss Crawford's beauty did her no disservice with the Miss Bertrams... [they) were almost as much charmed as their brothers, with her lively dark eye, clear brown complexion, and general prettiness. Had she been tall, full formed, and fair, it might have been more of a trial; but as it was, there could be no comparison, and she was most allowably a sweet pretty girl, while they were the finest young women in the country. (38-39)174 Adventures in Domesticity Evocative of the “brown beauty" Janet Shaw describes in Antigua or of West Indian mistresses, Mary's physical prowess is equated with sexual transgression, a correlation that casts suspicion on her emotional and moral fitness as well. Her attitude toward marriage, for instance, is mercenary: “Everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage” (38) and is based upon artifice: she speculates that her brother will eventually be "taken in” (40), or deceived, into matrimony. Worse than taking a purely economic interest in marriage, Mary describes Henry's attitude as humorously treacherous: “If you can persuade Henry to marry, you must have the address of a French-woman. All that English abilities can do, has been tried already” (37). His taste for novelty in romance parallels his penchant for novelty in estate improvement, a predilection Alisdair Duckworth reads as symbolic of Crawford's “rejection of a traditional shape of reality” in favor of a “wholesale redisposition of the structure” of the English country culture (52-53). Crawford's vision of marriage and estates is inimical to the ideology of domesticity that became more rigorously advocated in English fiction toward the end of the century when a prevailing revolutionary ethos provoked a flood of anti-jacobin literature." The Crawfords' social values are the very antithesis of the steady, landed, rural social values that underlay Austen's domestic ideology. Wealthy, mobile, and attached to no family or land, the Crawfords represent the kind of social fluidity that challenged rigid social categories, and by extension, the notion of a fixed English identity underwritten by stable domestic virtue. Part of Fanny's worth is that she will reinvigorate the gentry with bourgeois virtue. Crawford is clearly no “match” for her since his character is tainted with excesses evocative of the worst of both colonial and aristocratic culture. Henry Crawford is a libertine in the Creole style. While he possesses“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 175 the raw material to develop into a real gentleman, the vices of the admiral uncle who raised him have prevented the cultivation of virtue. He is the sexual predator in the novel, manipulating the conventions of gender relations for his pleasure, and after his failure at redemption, symbolized by Fanny's persistent refusal of his marriage proposal, he seduces Maria Bertram Rushworth into adultery. He is a worse threat even, than the foppish Mr. Yates, at whose instigation the Bertrams and Crawfords begin to act out the scandalously foreboding scenes of Koetzebue's Lover's Vows during Sir Thomas's Antigua visit. Crawford poses a more dire problem because of his insidiousness: he wears the mask of familiar respectability and possesses the outer trappings of the norms of the English countryside. Impressed by show (even Fanny remarks that he is a captivating actor and public speaker) the Bertrams are unaware that the charm of good manners is often deceptive. The worst threat to female virtue and domestic peace, then, comes from within. Crawford is like the Creole men of Jamaica whom Long describes: “With a strong natural propensity to the other sex, they are not always the most chaste and faithful of husbands.”ld Sexual stereotypes of Creoles as salacious were representative of the economic relation between the English aristocracy and West Indian planters; libertinage and intemperate sexuality in the West Indies both produced and resulted in the transgressive culture of plantation life and were the inverse of the powerful middle-class ethos of domestic virtue. Indeed, within the ideology of bourgeois domestic virtue that Austen promotes, libertine opportunism is often portrayed in a Creole style. The dual vilification of aristocratic frivolity and Creole culture was also a question of class since the West Indian plantocracy returned to England newly rich and desirous of Parliamentary seats and aristocratic titles." Branding white Creoles with the taint of West Indian or176 Adventures in Domesticity African culture was a way of simultaneously keeping class and race boundaries intact. Austen articulates these concerns most overtly in her unfinished novel, Sandition, where domesticity is troublingly unstable from the first topsy-turvy scene of the novel, which begins with an overturned carriage. The threat that the social order will be turned upside-down is present from the outset. At Sandition, colonial trade and creolization promise to energize the economy at the same time that they threaten financial and social stability. Mr. Parker, the land speculator who promotes his new seaside resort, Sandition, welcomes the potential invigoration of the economy brought to England by Creoles made very rich by West Indian slave plantations: “No people spend more freely, I believe, than W. Indians” (347). In late-eighteenth-century fiction, West Indian figures were as likely to be portrayed as profligate and dangerous as they were to be represented as a benefit to England. Both Creole men and women were described by their unmanageable temperaments and by their sexual proclivities, which threatened to destabilize traditional communal and familial life. Also of widespread concern were the mulatto and Creole children of West Indian planters who were often sent to England or Scotland during their formative years to be educated and as often as not remained in England, marrying England-born whites. Creoles thus represented a strata of society whose appeal and whose detractions underscored the contradictory relationship England had with colonial commerce and culture. Slave plantations could be described in the language of family relations by proslavery apologists, but that must have proved disturbing to many people who did not wish for their traditional domestic arrangements to be brought so close to West Indian society, even if only semantically. The wealthy widow and doyen of Sandition gives voice to just such contradictory feelings when she expresses her wish to have Sandition benefit from the patronage of a wealthy West“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 177 Indian, as well as her fears that economic instability might ensue: Ay — so I have heard — and because they have full Purses, fancy themselves equal, may be, to your old Country Families. But then, they who scatter their Money so freely, never think of whether they may not be doing mischief by raising the price of Things — And I have heard that's very much the case with your West- injines — and if they come among us to raise the price of our necessaries of Life, we shall not much thank them Mr. Parker. (347) Mrs. Griffiths, the West Indian, “supported herself by receiving such great girls and young Ladies, as wanted either Masters for finishing their Education, or a home for beginning their Displays.” Under her care was a seventeen-year-old “half Mulatto” who was "the very young Lady, sickly and rich” hoped for by Lady Denham, whose fervent wish is to unite her penniless baron nephew with female wealth (373-74). Since only approximately sixty pages of the manuscript to Sandition were completed prior to Austen's death, the relationship of creolization to the budding bathing-place never gets played out, but the fragment is sufficient to indicate that Austen was aware of commonplace stereotypes of West Indian figures and their complicated relationship to domesticity and to the domestic economy. The West Indies was widely depicted as a place where licentiousness was so deeply ingrained that mere proximity to its soil menaced Englishmen and women with corruption of both body and virtue. White Creole men were noted for their promiscuity, keeping mulatto mistresses in favor of white English wives, and most writers on the Caribbean commented on the widespread practice of rape — if not of slave women,178 Adventures in Domesticity then of Creole or mulatta mistresses. Moreover, Creole women were noted for being languid, a quality supposedly indicative of excessive concupiscence. The image of the West Indies was thus in sharp contrast with the sober industry and stable social structures of English domestic virtue. As the eighteenth-century wore on, such values were viewed as bourgeois, and the aristocracy was often associated with an urban libertinage, more or less consonant with the wayward culture of the Caribbean. The opposition of the Crawfords' aristocratic urbanity to Mansfield Park's rural gentry culture is symbolic of the socioeconomic relation between and among British colonies, London, and the English countryside. Urban centers like London were the site of import and export; cities were places where dangerous commodities and culture were brought to the shores of England, and whence they infiltrated the countryside. The Crawfords, Creole-like libertines, threaten to infect a healthy rural labor economy by weakening the tight-knit communities that are possible only when residents remain relatively immobile. “Young people of fortune” (35), they bring an urban perspective to the estate. Mary is unabashed about her well-crafted urbanity: “coming down with the true London maxim, that every thing is to be got with money, I was a little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs” (52).U But prudent industry at home was as much a source of anxiety as was slave labor and promiscuity in the colonies. Fears of the revolutionary changing status of laborers as England moved toward industrialism crossed with the fear that the needs of plantation management would siphon away the gentry from English soil, weakening the social fabric of the countryside. As a result, along with the flush of capital and colonial goods, colonial trade brought to England a fear of outsiders that infiltrated social commentary with invasion-like fantasies. Again, Cobbett's Rural Rides:“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 179 The war and the paper-system has brought in nabobs, negro-drivers, generals, admirals, governors, commissaries, contractors, pensioners, sinecurists, commissioners, loan- jobbers, lottery-dealers, bankers, stock-jobbers; not to mention the long and black list in gowns and three-tailed wigs. You can see but few good houses not in possession of one or the other of these. These, with the parsons, are now the magistrates. (qtd. in Williams 110) In fiction, anxiety over Cobbett's “nabobs [and] negro-drivers” registered as whitewashed Creole-like characters, such as the Crawfords of Mansfield Park, who threaten to savage traditional rural society with their crass wealth and compromised morality. Not solely an indictment of corrupt urban aristocracy, as previous Austen critics would have it,21 the Crawfords also represent danger to the stable morality of the countryside evocative of the sinister qualities ascribed to West Indian life. Cobbett believed that colonization would take the gentry — men like Sir Thomas — from its rural home and bring about a colonization of the English countryside.“ Anxious that a “diseased” social body would be the necessary consequence of colonial contact, Cobbett recoils from the absentee landlords who spend more time on their West Indian plantations than they do on their country estates: a resident native gentry, attached to the soil, known to every farmer and labourer from his childhood will become diseased by unhealthy interaction with a gentry, only now-and-then residing at all, having no relish for country- delights, foreign in their matters, distant and180 Adventures in Domesticity haughty in their behavior, looking to the soil only for its rents. (qtd. in Williams 110) In the early nineteenth century, during the time when Austen was writing Mansfield Park, military men as well as social theorists realized the importance of the English countryside to politics. One naval officer who had served in the West Indies before returning to England was said to have noted the politically fruitful location of the countryside to labor movements: “a regular organization in London ... would be .. . a moral impossibility.” But, he claimed, one in the "country is necessary” (Thompson 481). The question of “domestic" revolution, then, emerges as a particularly rural one.“ Fictional portraits of social disruptions were more circuitous. In Mansfield Park, dark-complected Mary Crawford's desire for Edmund Bertram threatens to separate the future clergyman from his country flock and infect the Bertram lineage with her compromised morality. Sir Thomas says of Edmund, “He knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can convey, and that if he does not live among his parishioners and prove himself by constant attention their well- wisher and friend, he does very little either for their good or his own."24 Mary's strength is admired by the Bertram girls, sisters noted for their lack of discrimination: “In the drawing-room Miss Crawford was also celebrated. Her merit in being gifted by nature with strength and courage was fully appreciated by the Miss Bertrams” (62). Moreover, her virility is depicted as selfish and therefore antisocial: “Nothing ever fatigues me, but doing what I do not like” (62). When Mary borrows Fanny's horse and fails to return it, leaving Fanny the jealous voyeur of her ride, her apology is specious and betrays her preference for flirtatious antisocial conduct instead of the more demure feminine qualities of modesty and self-denial:“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 181 “My dear Miss Price," said Miss Crawford, as soon as she was at all within hearing, “I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting — but I have nothing in the world to say for myself — I knew it was very late, and that I was behaving extremely ill; and, therefore, if you please, you must forgive me. Selfishness must always be forgiven you know, because there is no hope of a cure." (61) Mary is female sexuality out of control: “Miss Crawford's enjoyment of riding was such, that she did not know how to leave off" (60). Reminiscent of the popular anti-onanism texts of the eighteenth century, Mary's pleasure is inappropriately visible, excessive, and independent. She rather expects admiration, though it is certainly unnecessary to her fulfillment. Austen describes the complex nexus of desire surrounding Miss Crawford's self-directed enjoyment: Miss Crawford's enjoyment of riding was such, that she did not know how to leave off. Active and fearless, and, though rather small, strongly made, she seemed formed for a horsewoman; and to the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise, something was probably added in Edmund's attendance and instructions, and something more in the conviction of very much surpassing her sex in general by her early progress, to make her unwilling to dismount. (60) The sexual metaphor of horseback riding implicates her in illicit masturbatory pleasures as well as in an inappropriate sexual competition with other women.20 Edmund's interest in Mary is aroused in spite of his better judgment, and he cannot forbear admiring her “feminine182 Adventures in Domesticity lawlessness” (85). On a walk through Mr. Rushworth's grounds, Mary revels at her own physical strength, bragging that she is not fatigued in spite of the mile they must have covered during their promenade. Edmund corrects her: “Not half a mile,' was his sturdy answer; for he was not yet so much in love as to measure distance, or reckon time, with feminine lawlessness” (85). Mary is the feminine principle out of the bounds of reason, a malevolent influence that endangers the Bertram family. More notable because of its stark contrast to Fanny's debility, Mary's prowess is vilified. Her licentiousness and crass materialism are equated with the loss of social stability. Sir Thomas's absence in Antigua enables the Crawfords' promiscuous rearrangement of the Bertram's well- ordered estate. The improper staging of Koetzebue's play in the middle of the novel, a foreshadowing of Maria's adultery and Julia's elopement, constitutes a physical and moral transgression equivalent to a rebellion of subjects. Invading Sir Thomas's study, the Bertram children, the Crawfords, and Mr. Yates transform the seat of patriarchal rule at Mansfield into a theatrical space for their staging of Koetzebue's Lover's Vows. Enacting sexual transgressions, they make a literal display of the social violations they will enact later on in the novel: Maria will shame the fool (Mr. Rushworth) by having an adulterous affair with Henry, and Mary will prove to be bereft of the kind of feminine delicacy Edmund requires in a virtuous wife. Structurally, but also because of Austen's characterization of female vigor and sexuality, their violations of tradition and domesticity are suggestive of miscegenation and creolization in the colonies, where Sir Thomas's offstage presence is required for the management of his Antiguan affairs. When Sir Thomas returns from Antigua, the reaction of the acting party at Mansfield Park is collectively one of horrific excess: Julia announces his arrival “with a face all aghast"“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 183 (155). The narrator asks "How is the consternation of the party to be described?” The response is superlative fear: “To the greater number it was a moment of absolute horror" (157). Apart from Mr. Yates and Mr. Rushworth, whose feelings have been described as humorous narcissism (which is to say detached from public sentiment), the party is paralyzed with trepidation: "every other heart was sinking under some degree of self-condemnation or undefined alarm, every other heart was suggesting ‘What will become of us? what is to be done now?' It was a terrible pause; and terrible to every ear were the corroborating sounds of opening doors and passing footsteps" (157). It is a dramatic moment that nearly transforms Sir Thomas into a monster of gothic proportion. So great was their fear of law, rule, retribution, that "jealousy and bitterness had been suspended: selfishness was lost in the common cause” of deciding how to put the best possible face upon their transgressions. Although Fanny has not participated in the theatrics, her “agitation and alarm exceeded all that was endured by the rest ... She was nearly fainting: all her former habitual dread of her uncle was returning” (158). And while the Crawfords and Mr. Yates are "giving vent to their feelings of vexation,” Fanny sits down in an effort to calm her “excessive trembling" (158). In sum, the fear of Sir Thomas's return and the dread of reprisals produce excessive bodily responses. The realization of their transgressions is described in terms of corporeality. Guilt, fear, and desire are all lodged in the bodies of the actors whose only performance is that of excessive agitation. Such exorbitant expressions had been in good supply prior to Sir Thomas's arrival. Henry Crawford kindled the fires of jealousy with his inappropriate flirtation with Maria and, while Fanny can pity her cousin Julia, her fear that such surpluses of emotion will swell and burst into the calm rooms of Mansfield Park are justified: “Julia could never see Maria distinguished by Henry Crawford, without trusting that it184 Adventures in Domesticity would create jealousy, and bring a public disturbance at last" (146). As nearly every critic of the novel has noted, Henry and Maria's roles in Koetzebue's Lover's Vows anticipate their adultery and point to the crucial importance of the appearance of propriety. In the novel, representation of infidelity teeters dangerously close to the real thing.27 Fanny worries for Maria's reputation; an engaged woman should not play the part of an adulteress. Fanny's fear is that the staging of bodies rebelling against convention will set the stage for real transgressions. The visceral excess is a reminder of how inappropriate it is for women to engage in physical displays of themselves. Edmund is certain his father “would never wish his grown up daughters to be acting plays. His sense of decorum is strict.” But Edmund is apprehensive most especially about Maria's reputation: “it would be imprudent, I think, with regard to Maria, whose situation is a very delicate one, considering every thing, extremely delicate” (113). When a woman has contracted herself to be married, according to Edmund's sense of propriety, her body must not be available for public display, even where public is a space circumscribed by the family's private sitting rooms (113-14). Women's bodies must remain still lest they too closely resemble active bodies of cultural and moral others. This logic equates physical vigor and labor in women with moral poverty. In contrast to Mary's eagerness to enact adultery on the stage, Fanny steadfastly refuses to participate. But her refusal to act is itself an act of moral labor. Note the language of Tom Bertram's appeal to Fanny: "we want your services” (131). Her extreme disapproval of the scheme earns her the admiration of both Edmund and Sir Thomas. In reprobating the acting party to Sir Thomas, Edmund singles out Fanny as the guardian of propriety in a house “infected” with acting (“Yates brought the infection from Ecclesford, and it spread as those things always spread you know, sir” [166]): “We have all been more or less to blame,' said he, 'every one of us,“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 185 excepting Fanny. Fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout, who has been consistent. Her feelings have been steadily against it from first to last. She never ceased to think what was due to you. You will find Fanny every thing you could wish” (168-69). Fanny's weakness and her inability to work — even picking roses or acting — without exhaustion signals her moral elevation and marks her as the ideal candidate for marrying Edmund and, ironically, revitalizing the estate at Mansfield Park. Class/status fluidity may have been a desirable thing for men who made their fortunes trading in the West Indies. For most women in a sexualized labor economy, however, class/status fluidity usually meant downward mobility and the threat of lost virtue. Defoe's Roxana and Moll were so admirable because they were able to manipulate that system to their advantage. Unlike that of her literary predecessors, however, Fanny's mobility is delimited by the desires of others. In Mansfield Park, Austen figures scenes of travel in order to demonstrate the vulnerability of women to unwanted physical and social mobility. Maria and Mrs. Norris's banishment, and Fanny's importation to and deportation from Mansfield Park, inculcate in Fanny and in the reader right ideas about women, sexuality, and labor. Spend your sexual capital outside of a patriarchal economy and suffer in exile. Such is the message to both Maria and Fanny. Fanny, in Sir Thomas's view, must marry Henry Crawford or end up a working drudge like her mother. I have been arguing that the domestic ideology that structures the novel endorses one of the central tenets of patriarchy and imperialism: cultural difference can be defined according to the role of female labor in a society. Moreover, while the use of female labor as symbol of moral value defines difference, it also tempers anxiety about cultural mixing by assimilating difference into the narrative of domesticity. The importance of controlling female reproductive labor — the186 Adventures in Domesticity management of female sexuality — is visible throughout the novel. When Fanny rejects the marriage proposal of Henry Crawford she incurs the wrath of Sir Thomas, who views her "wilful and perverse” refusal as a lack of “consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you" (288). Determined to secure what would be an advantageous connection for his family, Sir Thomas scolds Fanny, derogating what he calls an "independence of spirit, which prevails so much in modern days, even in young women, and which in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence” (288). Sir Thomas's “violent antipathy" to Fanny's resistance is, as Claudia Johnson points out, “anchored in ... postrevolutionary discourse . . . where the merits of thinking for oneself were widely debated” (104). Dissension was especially troubling in women, as it could bring about the kind of “feminine lawlessness” Edmund Bertram feared — the kind that was said to defy patriarchal rationality. His censure not effective in quelling Fanny's rebellious emotions, Sir Thomas can only account for her conduct by suggesting that she does “not quite know [her own feelings” (286), a conclusion drawn from a series of (mis)readings of Fanny's quite visible emotions. Visual legibility replaces verbal assertions; when Sir Thomas first approaches Fanny on the subject of Henry Crawford's proposals, “Fanny's colour grew deeper and deeper ... to a degree that made either speaking or looking up quite impossible” (283). And later, when Sir Thomas fearfully and circuitously asks whether her affections are engaged to her cousin Edmund, Fanny speaks an "inarticulate ‘no,' but her face was scarlet.” Aware that her body speaks for her, she strives “to fortify herself beyond betraying it” (286). Fanny's blush is what Mary Ann O'Farrell has called “the blush that reddens the white lie," an "animating resistance” that “recovers a sense of bodily presence in manners.” It is a form of physical resistance that replaces speech for Fanny. She may vocalize propriety but her body“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 187 speaks resistance. In a similar moment, Crawford is able only to elicit sparse "reluctant answers” to his more insistent questions. Fanny's most garrulous reply is “a flush of vexation” (313), forceful enough to communicate her sentiments regarding their conference. Fanny's silence incorrectly conveys the idea that she will be malleable, but her physical responses, the "significatory excess as represented in the blush” (O'Farrell 8) betrays her incendiary determination and convinces Sir Thomas that her will must be conquered. Recall from the passage that opened the chapter that Sir Thomas intended Fanny's trip to Portsmouth as a “medicinal project upon his niece's understanding, which he must consider as at present diseased” (335). His corrective proves successful; from the moment she arrives, Fanny disparages her former Portsmouth home with descriptions that make clear the gulf between the world of the country gentry and that of the port- town house. She is "ashamed” of Portsmouth, and is “ashamed of her father [more] than of all the rest,” “sadly pained by his language and his smell of spirits” (365, 346). Her mother is described in a deluge of condemnation; she is "so comfortless, so slatternly, so shabby” that Fanny can not forbear comparing Mrs. Price to the coifed and comfortable Lady Bertram, a comparison that “often grieved her to the heart" (372). Fanny's brothers are called “loud and overbearing," "untameable,” “riotous” (356); they "burst” into rooms with “hot faces and panting breaths, ... kicking each other's shins, and hallooing out at sudden starts” (349). She is “almost stunned” (347) by the “daily evils of her father's house” (407), a place of “noise rising upon noise, and bustle upon bustle, men and boys at last all in motion together" (350). Even the “maid-servant” is “trollopy-looking” (342). And the house itself writhes in seeming animation: “it was the abode of noise, disorder, and impropriety. Nobody was in their right place, nothing was done as it ought to be” (354).188 Adventures in Domesticity Sir Thomas's “medicine” permeates Fanny's constitution as well as her consciousness of status and domesticity. She fancies herself an "exile” (357) who spends her time in Portsmouth “in a state of penance” (392). The rebellious subject returns fully converted: "How her heart swelled with joy and gratitude, as she passed the barriers of Portsmouth" (406). She travels with Edmund and her younger sister, Susan, who is brought as Fanny's replacement. Fanny's surveillance of the landscape mimics Susan's meditation on the trappings of wealth. While Susan entertained “visions of good and ill breeding, of old vulgarisms and new gentilities, ... silver forks, napkins, and finer glasses,” Fanny's “perceptions and her pleasures were of the keenest sort” when "her eye fell every where on lawns and plantations of the freshest green” (407). With a surprisingly sensual eye, she thrills to the landscape: “the trees, though not fully clothed, were in that delightful state, when farther beauty is known to be at hand, and when, while much is actually given to the sight, more yet remains for the imagination” (407). Fanny's seductive pleasure in this feminized landscape is also a self-directed one: “her enjoyment, however, was for herself alone” (407-48). Similarly, during the earlier journey the Mansfield party makes to Mr. Rushworth's estate, Fanny is content to be excluded from the general conversation, preferring instead private pleasures: her "thoughts and reflections were habitually her best companions.” Intending to survey the grounds to plan for the estate's improvement, Fanny "whose rides had never been extensive, was soon beyond her knowledge, and was very happy in observing all that was new, and admiring all that was pretty” (72). Like European explorers and American colonists before her, she visually caresses “the lay of the land,” to use Annette Kolodny's words, crossing a landscape ripe with the promise of future domestic virtue. Fanny's pleasure is noteworthy not simply because it is self-directed but because it defies the other characters' pain.“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 189 When Fanny learns from Edmund of Maria and Henry Crawford's flight into adultery and Julia's elopement, the news comes with a summons from Mansfield Park. Edmund's letter closes with ominous portent: “There is no end to the evil let loose upon us” (404). Far from sharing in his lugubrious reflections, Fanny reacts in a curious fashion: “She was, she felt she was, in the greatest danger of being exquisitely happy, while so many were miserable. The evil which brought such good to her! She dreaded lest she should learn to be insensible of it" (404). Responding contrary to the general mood, against the collective sentiment, Fanny is a secret rebel, and one who fears the loss of her ability to feel her illicit) excess of emotion. Maria's moral failure is Fanny's exultation and social elevation. She will be saved from a future of noise and disorder, and may return to Mansfield Park in the role of savior. The last hurdle to Edmund and Fanny's marriage is overcome when Edmund rejects Mary Crawford because of her inadequate condemnation of Henry and Maria's adultery: “it was the detection, not the offence which she reprobated” (415). Edmund tells Fanny about his meeting with Mary in a scene that sizzles with condemnation and desire. Not just the absence of horror, but the fact of speech is what Edmund finds contemptible in Mary. Her speech supplants his: “before he had been able to speak one intelligible sentence, she had introduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him” (414). Mary's inappropriate speech is contrasted with Fanny's quiet nature, and Edmund worries that even the narration of such moral transgressions will be too indelicate for Fanny to bear: “but how she went on, Fanny, is not fit — is hardly fit to be repeated to you I cannot recall all her words. I would not dwell upon them if I could” (414). Mary reads their adultery as foolish but as an act that can be concealed. She views morality as strategic, and regrets their lack of discretion rather than the moral transgression. Such a view of morality,190 Adventures in Domesticity of sexuality, is so contemptible to Edmund that the narration itself becomes broken, disjointed. He rants in fragmented sentences: To hear the woman whom — no harsher name than folly given! — So voluntarily, so freely, so coolly to canvass it! – No reluctance, no horror, no feminine — shall I say? no modest loathings! — This is what the world does. For where, Fanny, shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed? — Spoilt, spoilt! (415) In his speech, the trope of adulteration rears its mottled head. When traditional values are corrupted, female virtue is "spoilt." Edmund sees Mary as sick with a "perversion of mind,” guilty of "blunted delicacy and a corrupted, vitiated mind” (416). Mary's fall in Edmund's esteem, like Eve's fall from grace, represents the corruption of pure womanhood, of female potential “richly endowed” but compromised, sullied. And he is sick with the thought of how close he came to marrying Mary, to perpetuating that corruption of morality through his bloodline. Although Austen clearly wants her contemporary reader to value Fanny's moral labor of inactivity, it is difficult for modern readers to forbear admiring Mary in this scene of culmination where, in the spirit of Helene Cixous's “Laugh of the Medusa,” she responds to his condemnation with "a sort of laugh” (418). In perhaps the most seductive and dangerous scene in all of Austen's novels, Mary, like the Medusa, compels Edmund to cast his eyes upon her one last time: “Mr. Bertram,” said she. I looked back. “Mr. Bertram,” said she, with a smile — but it was a smile ill-suited to the conversation that had“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 191 passed, a saucy playful smile, seeming to invite, in order to subdue me; at least it appeared to me. I resisted; it was the impulse of the moment to resist, and still walked on. I have since - sometimes for a moment - regretted that I did not go back; but I know I was right; and such has been the end of our acquaintance! And what an acquaintance has it been! How have I been deceived! (419) The dashes in Edmund's' narrative — the unspeakable absences – those are the transgressions that push at the boundaries of Austen's narrative. The dangers of a changing world are dramatized in the seductive evils of inappropriate female sexuality. They are, to use Edmund's description of Maria's adultery, “the evil let loose upon us.” But in spite of Mary's “saucy” appeal, we must not be her dupes. The work of the modern reader is to admire Fanny's “active principle[s]” (422) over Mary's leisured “accomplishments.” It is fitting that the cuckold Mr. Rushworth should articulate the novel's impossible desire. In a world where female activity threatens to bring down the estate, they might, as Rushworth petulantly wishes, all be “a great deal better employed, sitting comfortably here among ourselves, and doing nothing” (167). Notes Young, Colonial Desire: Hybridity in Theory, Culture and Race (New York: Routledge, 1995), 99. He describes the dialectic of colonial desire as "a structure of attraction, where people and cultures intermix and merge, transforming themselves as a result, and as structure of repulsion, where the different elements remain distinct and are set against each other dialogically. The idea of race here shows itself to be profoundly dialectical: it only works when defined against192 Adventures in Domesticity potential intermixture, which also threatens to undo its calculations altogether” (19). z Lawrence Stone's An Open Elite?: England, 1540 1880 (New York: Harper and Row, 1979) treats this subject of class formation and mobility. Feminist and postcolonial critics have variously embraced and repudiated Austen for her defiance of or complicity with patriarchy and imperialism. Some feminist critics have read race as a trope for gender, viewing literary representations of slavery as a metaphor for the position of women in the marriage market. For debates about Austen and feminism, see Mary Poovey, The Proper Lady and the Woman Writer: Ideology as Style in the Works of Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Shelley, and Jane Austen (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984); Claudia Johnson, Jane Austen: Women, Politics, and the Novel (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988); Margaret Kirkham, Jane Austen, Feminism, and Fiction (Totowa, NJ: Barnes and Noble Books, 1983); Jan Fergus, “The Professional Woman Writer," in The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen, ed. Edward Copeland and Juliet McMaster (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1997); and Devoney Looser, “Reading Jane Austen and Rewriting 'Herstory”” in Critical Essays on Jane Austen, ed. Laura White (New York: G.K. Hall & Co., 1998). These arguments have focused most often on Mansfield Park, arguably Austen's dullest and most prudish novel. Readers explain the drastic change in character from the “light, bright, and sparkling" Elizabeth Bennett of Pride and Prejudice to the dowdy, priggish Fanny Price as the result of Fanny's subjugation to patriarchal tyranny, and mine the text for references to Sir Thomas's sugar plantation on Antigua. Such readings require that, as Ruth Perry puts it, “one has to read Austen's fictional references to slavery and colonialism“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 193 structurally.” This perspective analyzes the relationship between colonial history and gender politics discursively: “Slavery in these novels figures the dependent status of women without money of their own. The “slave trade' is trope for the marriage market and for the tyranny of marriage, a displacement of the subject status of captive Africans onto women” (“Jane Austen and Empire: A thinking Woman's Guide to British Imperialism,” Persuasions 16 [1994]). Similarly, Moira Ferguson reads Mansfield Park as “a quasi- allegory of colonial-gender relations,” where the subject status of women echoes and stands in for the novel's “dead silence" about the slave trade. This view argues the flip side of Perry's metaphoric relation: Sir Thomas's demand that Fanny accept Henry Crawford's unappealing offer of marriage, among other such imperious demands, is a trope for the tyranny of the slave trade: Thus gender relations at home parallel and echo traditional relationships of power between the colonialists and colonized peoples: European women visibly signify the most egregiously and invisibly repressed of the text – African- Caribbeans themselves. They mark silent African-Caribbean rebels as well as their own disenfranchisement, class and gender victimization. (“Mansfield Park” 103) Responding directly or not, these readers engage what Susan Fraiman calls the "gender politics underlying [Edward Said's] postcolonial project,” a project that included Austen in the list of writers whose work created a culture of imperial domination (807). For roughly a decade, since the publication of Edward Said's Culture and Imperialism (New York: Random House, 1994) at least, feminist critics have endeavored to complicate postcolonial studies by addressing structural and metaphoric194 Adventures in Domesticity overlaps and intersections between the social condition of white English women and black African or Caribbean slaves. In "Jane Austen and Empire,” said views Sir Thomas's plantation and the estate at Mansfield Park as materially and dialectically related to one another: “Austen saw what Fanny does as a domestic of small-scale movement in space that corresponds to the longer, more openly colonial movements of Sir Thomas, her mentor, the man whose estate she inherits. The two movements depend on each other" (Said, Culture 157). For studies that read Austen in the context of imperialism, see Moira Ferguson, “Mansfield Park: Slavery, Colonialism, and Gender" in Critical Essays, ed. White (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1998); Perry, “Austen and Empire: A Thinking Woman's Guide to British Imperialism"; Judith Terry, “Sir Thomas Bertram's ‘Business in Antigua,”” Persuasions 17 (1995); Kuldip Kuwahara, “Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, Property, and the British Empire,” Persuasions 17 (1995); and Susan Fraiman, “Jane Austen and Edward Said: Gender, Culture, and Imperialism,” Critical Inquiry 21.4 (Summer 1995) which responds directly to Said's reading, criticizing it for its failure to account for gender as a mitigating force in the imperialist logic he sees as structuring the novel. Linda Colley, Britons: Forging the Nation 1707–1837 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992), 253. See her chapter 6, “Womanpower" for a discussion of the intellectual and political debates over the role of women in society throughout the eighteenth century. ibid., 239-40. Following the publication of Rousseau's Emile (1762, translated to English in 1770), whose work naturalized sexual difference, Colley claims that moralists and novelists alike emphasized an ideology of separate spheres that“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 195 combined with a national campaign to increase the population in England: “Encouraging women to breed, urging the benefits of maternal breast-feeding over wet-nursing, rescuing foundlings and orphans, all of these causes became increasingly attractive to British legislators, pundits and charitable bodies in the second half of the eighteenth century, for practical as well as humanitarian reasons" (240). Of nationalism and breast-feeding in particular, she write: “The confines of the home were the boundaries of her (the English woman) kingdom. This was where she exercised a gentle and improving sway over her husband and forged the next generation, breast-feeding and brainwashing her children into patriotic virtue. Women who neglected their families for the outside world, who put their infants out to nurse, or worst of all, practiced birth control, endangered the polity and violated their own natures” (239). Colley included Austen among a list of novelists and social theorists who were influenced by “Rousseau's sexual politics” (240). 6 Bryan Edwards's widely read History Civil and Commercial, of the British Colonies in the West Indies (London: 1794–1801) ties sexuality and labor to climate, a common rhetorical gesture that, as Felicity Nussbaum has argued, participated in the formation of a sexual cartography of the world: “the torrid, temperate, and frigid zones of the globe were formative in imagining that a sexualized woman of empire was distinct from domestic English womanhood," distinctions that “appeared in the natural histories” of the eighteenth century (Torrid Zones: Maternity, Sexuality, and Empire in Eighteenth-Century Enlish Narratives Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1995), 7). European travel writing that mapped out Africa and the Caribbean was structured around a set of rhetorical norms that included sexuality and domesticity every bit as much as it did landscape description and political commentary.196 Adventures in Domesticity See Edward Long, History of Jamaica, ed.

" In his Marxist critique of nineteenth-century fiction, From Custom to Capital: The English Novel and the Industrial Revolution (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1981), Igor Webb reads Austen's fiction as industrial novels, claiming that they "register the fundamental transformation of England from an“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 197 agrarian to an industrial nation — from custom to capital” (25). On Austen and class, see Raymond Williams, The Country and the City (New York: Oxford University Press, 1975); Juliet McMaster, “Class,” and Edward Copeland, “Money,” in The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1997); James Thompson, in Between Self and World (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1988), claims that “Austen's morality is ideological, for it serves as a form of justification or defense of her class, but it does not consciously serve as a form of exclusion, containing or repressing an opposition class . . . Because the laboring classes rarely enter into this picture except as docile servants, there is no need to exclude them from the park or to represent them as a contained class” (39). On the contrary, I will argue that the threat of class difference is deeply felt at Mansfield Park, and that it figures into the morality of the novel. 12 Qtd. in Williams, The Country and the City, 109. In Jane Austen's Emma, critics have cited as an example of the discursive and structural relation between women and slaves Jane Fairfax's imminent entrance into the labor economy as a governess, work she is forced into because of her furtive and delayed engagement to Frank Churchill. Fairfax describes her future prospects thus: “When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid to being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something — Offices for the sale — not quite of human flesh — but of human intellect” (204). While readers could also argue that Austen viewed Fairfax's social predicament as a problem of women's vulnerability to class demotion, her language demonstrates the way in which female labor evoked both class and race issues alike. It also shows how writers articulated anxiety over slave labor and class status with an overlapping vocabulary.198 Adventures in Domesticity 4 Laura Brown, Ends of Empire: Women and Ideology in Early Eighteenth-Century English Literature (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1993), 15. Brown argues that the development of mercantile capitalist ideology depended upon the transformation of the figure of the woman from producer of goods (laborer) to female “figure of passivity, which is connected to the devaluation of women's labor and the growth of female consumption” (20). She focuses on the role of the English domestic woman as symbol of colonial wealth: “female adornment becomes the main cultural emblem of commodity fetishims” (119). Under this formulation, Lady Bertram's desire for two East India shawls in Mansfield Park represents the relationship between England and the Far East as one based upon an exploitative economy of gender and cultural difference. When Fanny's brother William embarks upon his naval career, Lady Bertram comes to life long enough to command the return of exotic vestments: “Fanny, William must not forget my shawl, if he goest to the East Indies; and I shall give him a commission for any thing else that is worth having. I wish he may go to the East Indies, that I may have my shawl. I think I will have two shawls, Fanny” (277). Her desire increases the moment she articulates it. Lady Bertram's focus on commodity indicates that colonial spaces are valued for their ability to fulfill the desires of leisured Englishwoman. See also Nussbaum's Torrid Zones, which examines the relationship among various representations of colonial and British women, arguing that “the invention of the 'other' woman of empire enabled the consolidation of the cult of domesticity in England, and at the same time, the association of the sexualized woman at home with the exotic, or 'savage,' non-European woman” (1). " Anxiety over the position of women intensified during the tumultuous revolutionary years around the turn of the“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing" 199 century: "it was scarcely surprising that pre-existing anxieties about the position of women should have become still more intense in Britain after war with France broke out in 1793. Even more than before, both sexes, but particularly women, were deluged by conduct books, sermons, homilies, novels and magazine articles insisting that good order and political stability necessitated the maintenance of separate sexual spheres” (Colley, Britons, 31). Johnson's study, Jane Austen: Women, Politics, and the Novel, addresses Austen's responses to the impact of social unrest on the role of women in polite society. See especially chapter 5, “Mansfield Park: Confusions of Guilt and Revolution of Mind.” Johnson claims that Fanny's feebleness makes her something of an ur-woman of delicacy rather than a Christian hero (95). This characterization contrasts with that of Lady Bertram, whose comatose luxury Johnson calls indicative of "Austen's treatment of the vitiating tendencies of female manners” that bear a similarity to Wollstonecraft's belief that women ought not to be encouraged to be helpless in order to be considered feminine. Johnson sees Lady Bertram's “female weakness” as representative of the kind of “beauty [that] enforces submission and inhibits unruliness, not by any unseemly assertion of imperiousness — such would trespass on the manly domain of the sublime and excite discordant passions of dread – but rather by arousing a melting solicitude” (98). In Laughing Feminism: Subversive Comedy in Frances Burney, Maria Edgeworth, and Jane Austen (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1998), Audrey Bilger reads the relationship between the female characters in Mansfield Park in order to understand Austen's position on "authoritarian politics." Bilger attributes Mrs. Norris's comeuppance as a result of Austen's “subversive feminism.” Austen "condemn[s] women who oppress other women as complicit in a system that enforces female subjugation” (185).200 Adventures in Domesticity 16 Janet Shaw's Journal of a Lady of Quality; being the narrative of a journey from Scotland to the West Indies, North Carolina, and Portugal, in the years 1774 to 1776 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1921) was written as private correspondence. Her comment about “brown beauty” was written in the context of her meditation on the differences between Englishwomen and white Creole women in Antigua. Helena Wells's 1800 novel, Constantia Neville; or, the West Indian, feared “contamination from the negroes, whose immoral discourse and corrupted dialict” endangered Englishwomen. She was no kinder to West Indian women, whom she saw as both threatening and endangered by sexual vice: “there was no instance of any resident having a white mistress; all men of fortune, who were not married, had their brown women” (qtd. and cited in Gretchen Gerzina's Black London: Life Before Emancipation [New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1995), 74).

As a result of the rise of the wealthy planter class that made its money in the West Indies, social theorists worried that miscegenation could eventually result in a dispersal of property to blacks or mulattos and would ill serve the white English women who were the rightful spouses and mothers of moneyed English gentlemen (Long bk. 2, 330-31).“A Great Deal Better Employed Doing Nothing” 201 For concise discussions of growing advances of West Indian influence in Parliament, see “The Formation of Caribbean Plantation Society, 1689–1748" by Richard Sheridan and “The British West Indies in the Age of Abolition, 1748–1815” by J.R.

His (again) flirtatious fancies of colonial travel reveal a character of desultory and self- indulgent interests. When Fanny's brother, William, visits Mansfield Park to tell stories of his travels in the West Indies, Crawford “longed to have been at sea, and seen and done and suffered as much ... The glory of heroism, of usefulness, of exertion, of endurance, made his own habits of selfish indulgence appear in shameful contrast; and he wished he had been a William Price, distinguishing himself and working his way to fortune and consequence with so much self-respect and happy ardour, instead of what he was! The wish was rather202 Adventures in Domesticity eager than lasting” (213). See Tanner and Duckworth on this point. 23 Tanner notes that “In Mansfield Park, quite a lot can be told about people from their differing attitudes to rural life" (Jane Austen, 145). And, as Williams's brilliant Marxist reading of capitalism, land, and literature argues, one's relationship to the land was indicative of not only Tory or Whig sympathies, but a whole range of beliefs about tradition and social mores. As Williams points out, Austen lived in "a high bourgeois society” that was in the midst of negotiating the collision of the landed gentry with the newly wealthy trading class: “An openly acquisitive society, which is concerned also with the transmission of wealth, is trying to judge itself at once by an inherited code and by the morality of improvement” (Williams, The Country and the City, 115). "Improvements” came about in numerous ways – from the plans for estate improvement by people like Capability Brown or Henry Repton to the agents of wealth who could authorize such changes, such as trading merchants who had dealings with occidental, spice, sugar, and slave trades. Austen, Mansfield Park, 224. In Igor Webb's cultural Marxist critique of Austen's novels as industrial fiction, he narrows his focus on the sugar trade's ubiquitous influence: “of course we expect the relationship was between colony and commerce; but the actual relationship was between the colonies and the whole ruling class, particularly the landed gentry” (Webb, From Custom to Capital, 105). 25 See, for instance, “Onanism display'd: being, I. An enquiry into the true nature of Onan's sin” (London: printed for E. Curll, 1719): William Farrer's “A short treatise on onanism: or, the detestable vice of self-pollution.

(Dublin: printed for James Williams, 1772). 26 The article that drew attention to such ideas was Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, “Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl," Critical Inquiry 17.4 (Summer 1991). In Northanger Abbey (1818), an earlier novel, Austen warns of the dangers of romance in forming a young girl's mind by mocking gothic novels like Anne Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794). In this mock literary treatise on female education, she warns against romantic notions and gothic fiction, suggesting that young virgins were not to be textually excited, for word and deed were perilously close. The concurrent proliferation of conduct manuals correspond curiously with the novel's stories of "spoiled” virgins, cautioning that excess emotions can lead to other sorts of excesses, usually of a sexual nature. 28 28 Fraiman, “Jane Austen and Edward Said,” and Ferguson, “Mansfield Park,” view this scene as evidence for the connection between the position of women and slaves in the logic of Austen's novel. 29 Mary Ann O'Farrell, Telling Complexions: The Nineteenth-Century English Novel and the Blush (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1997) 8, 17, 29.

Frankenstein provides a fitting conclusion to this book because it is a novel about domesticity and difference. The trope of adulterated domesticity dominates the novel, and Shelley folds domestic narratives back on themselves to account for and cope with the dangers of difference. The multilayered story of Dr. Frankenstein's domestic lives is the story of colonial relations writ small. Like the sentimental abolitionist fiction I discussed in chapter 3, Frankenstein's story of familial corruption resonates with national importance. For, as I have argued, the story of the English domestic family is also the story of the colonial nation. Domestic discourse supplied the lexicon by which England could understand itself as a colonial nation. In Frankenstein, relations of domination and difference get played out in domestic narratives. To begin with, Shelley uses the language of slavery and the trope of adulteration to talk about domestic affairs. Second, Shelley represents class and race mixings as menacing to bourgeois domestic ideology. From the very beginning of the novel, domesticity isMonstrous Adventures in Domesticity 205 constructed as a (failed, troubled) panacea for society's ills. But embedded in the narrative of what Shelley called “domestic affection” is the monstrous threat of adulteration. Because of that the novel ultimately disallows domestic happiness. In contrast to what other critics have claimed, I assert that it is not the threat of uncontrollable reproduction between Frankenstein's creature and his bride that drives Frankenstein to abort his project for the creature's bride. Rather, it is the threat of miscegenation. Frankenstein fears that the Monster's bride “might ... turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man” (144) and reproduce monstrous hybrids whose “filthy” resemblance to Man would spell out the destruction “of the whole human race” (117, 145). So menacing is the threat of adulteration in the novel that it murders the peace of the domestic home and the global nation. Thus Shelley's narrative of domestic relations is a fictive version of colonial relations. Consider, for instance, the novel's characters. Frankenstein is a benevolent man whose scientific impulses follow the familiar trajectory of the Enlightenment traveler who voyages away from home and domesticates difference in exotic lands. The Monster, a site onto which has been located class and gender anxieties, is also a figure of the dangerous, powerful, darker other. And his bride bears resemblance to the female Creole figures discussed in chapter 2 — women who threaten to adulterate virtuous bourgeois men. Moreover, the Monster's autodidacticism is represented as a danger, foreshadowing British and American fears that slaves who educate themselves will revolt against their owners. Colonial subjects — slaves (when they were allowed to be schooled) and, later, Indian pupils — had to be educated into “docile bodies” who would authorize their subjugation. Frankenstein brings together a number of ideas with which this book has been concerned: British attitudes toward colonial others; the influence of colonial difference on206 Adventures in Domesticity England's' self-conception; the relationship between domesticity and colonial adulteration. The novel is useful to a study of eighteenth-century narrative because, published in 1818, it stands at an important juncture in English literary and social history. The English slave trade had been abolished in 1807 but emancipation in the colonies was decades ahead. And, as colonial England moved toward becoming Britain, whose imperial sun never set, concerns about slave uprisings and colonial difference began to overlap with fears of labor unions and class difference. Thus, ideologically and historically, the novel bridges the gap between the Enlightenment and the Romantic eras, periods too often seen as discrete. Perhaps most important, though, is that while Frankenstein is not set in England, the failure of domesticity to save Dr. Frankenstein's home and nation from infiltration by the figure of “filthy” otherness tropologically connects the novel with those discussed in the previous four chapters. In claiming that the domesticity that rules Victor Frankenstein's world is underwritten by the kind of affective domestic obligation that was foundational to the ideology of nineteenth-century slave societies, my critique of the domestic trope in Frankenstein departs from a number of feminist critiques of the novel in several important ways. As I pointed out earlier, recent feminist scholarship has read eighteenth and nineteenth century literature and history based on a theory of separate spheres, which coded as feminine the private sphere of the domestic home and as masculine the public sphere of the social world: adventure, travel, education, science, etc. Johanna Smith, for instance, argues that Frankenstein endorses the theory of separate spheres, locating "domestic affection" within the confines of the feminized home, and claims that paternal “benevolence” feminizes the novel's patriarchs:- “The novel shows that the private virtues inculcated in the home by the domestic affections cannot arm men against the public sphere unless they emulate these feminine and domesticMonstrous Adventures in Domesticity 207 qualities" (314). She further claims that the sense of obligation that underwrites the Frankensteins' domestic relations is bound up in the novel's definition of femininity (321). While Smith claims that “men control the domestic sphere” (323), she views domesticated men as feminized. But in the early nineteenth century, obligation and benevolence were primarily based on a masculine, patriarchal domesticity that most closely resembles that propounded by late eighteenth- and nineteenth-century proslavery apologists. According to the logic of nineteenth-century proslavery apologists, like American George Fitzhugh, “domestic affection” would guarantee that slaves were treated as lovingly as white family members. Fitzhugh, who produced a large body of writing in favor of slavery, viewed domestic slavery as the "natural" condition of man. He opposed the nascent ideas of free market capitalism and refuted the Enlightenment idea that men were born free and could surrender that freedom in exchange for Social rights and privileges. Instead, he maintained that since men were naturally unequal, those who were in power had the "obligation” to care for those who were inferior, and slavery was the ideal “model of associated labor" (69): Slavery protects the infants, the aged and the sick; nay, takes far better care of them than of the healthy, the middle-aged and the strong. They are part of the family; and self-interest and domestic affection combine to shelter, shield and foster them. A man loves not only his horses and his cattle, which are useful to him, but he loves his dog, which is of no use. He loves them because they are his. What a wise and beneficent provision of Heaven, that makes the selfishness of man's nature a protecting aegis to shield and defend wife and children,208 Adventures in Domesticity slave and even dumb animals. (70, emphasis mine) Fitzhugh's notion of affectionate, possessive benevolence was not a new idea. Robinson Crusoe describes his famous enslavement of Friday in loving terms. Of “my Man Friday," Crusoe says: “I believe he lov’d me more than it was possible for him ever to love any Thing before" (154). In my discussion of Richard Cumberland's sentimental play, The West Indian (chapter 2), we saw a similar move to romanticize and domesticate colonial power relations. Like those writers before him, Fritzhugh overlaps the discourses of romantic servitude and political domination. Specifically, Fitzhugh viewed the domestic slave home as a miniature of the domestic slave society, one which he saw as sympathetic to the principles of socialism, communism, and even English labor union parties. Since wealth was achieved through avarice, Fitzhugh turned to what he viewed as the healthier, more equitable greed of slavery and family life, where the patriarch's possession of his slaves, wife, and children “naturally” produced in him feelings of "domestic affection" (70). Nineteenth-century proslavery arguments evolved, along with the development of scientific racism,' into a theory based on a possessive affection that, Fitzhugh said, resulted in a productive dialect of feeling: “Slavery identifies the interests of rich and poor, master and slave, and begets domestic affection on the one side, and loyalty and respect on the other” (68). Domestic affection was thus posited as the basis for the health of the slave society. Domesticity and slavery were ideologically linked on numerous levels. Often, early-nineteenth-century writers depicted social ills, particularly slavery, as a disease that was curable by domestic, white Englishwomen, like Frankenstein's sister/ wife Elizabeth, who were figured as guardians of domestic virtue. And, as my discussion of Jamaican planterMonstrous Adventures in Domesticity 209 Edward Long showed, by the time Shelley wrote Frankenstein, both popular abolitionist and proslavery discourse depended upon the domestic as trope for familial and social well-being. Recall that when Jamaican planter Edward Long feared that “promiscuous intercourse" would “dissolve the institution of marriage,” which he viewed as “one of the main links of society," what he feared most was miscegenation (see chapter 2). Illegitimate English heirs were one thing, but property ought not to be bequeathed to racial others. Long's focus was on Caribbean plantation slavery and English Creoles, and Fitzhugh wrote most of his tracts about American domestic slavery. But more than fifty years after Long's History of Jamaica, Fitzhugh, too, saw “the master-slave relationship ... as a family matter" (qtd. Genovese 199). One interesting difference between the abolitionist and proslavery writers is that the abolitionist poets (mostly women) feminized domesticity, while proslavery apologists focused on patriarchal benevolence as well as feminine virtue (or corruption). In all cases, domesticity was politicized, and family relations were imbued with national importance. Moreover, as I argued in chapter 3, women abolitionist poets harnessed this popular cult of feeling to their cause. At the same time, proslavery apologists were able to masculinize that rhetoric of sensibility by lauding benevolent domestic affection as foundational to the domestic home and the domestic nation. Sensibility may have been the domain of virtuous white Englishwomen, but benevolence belonged primarily to European and Euro- American white men and was also used as a counter to colonial social ills. Consider the way similar formulations of domestic obligation and benevolence operate in Shelley's novel. Frankenstein articulates his struggle to navigate his domestic relationship with the Monster in the language of slavery When Frankenstein meditates that his scientific endeavors have cause him to ignore his familial responsibilities, he concludes210 Adventures in Domesticity that "if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Caesar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed” (59). The neglect of "domestic affections” results in the enslavement and destruction of nations. He envisions an endogamous domesticity through which the nation will flourish in good social health. Domestic affection is also clearly characterized as masculine since the adventurous man, like Frankenstein, could prevent worldly ills by attending to his home. Shelley's novel also bears a strange ideological resemblance to Fitzhugh's narrative of social and family life in Sociology for the South in part because the monstrous outcome of Frankenstein's bourgeois individualism wreaks havoc on the family and threatens the family of mankind. And like Fitzhugh's idealized domestic slave family, Frankenstein's domestic portraits are shaped by images of affectionate possession. Of his parents, Dr. Frankenstein says, “We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed” (45, my emphasis). His description of familial relations in the language of political domination is reminiscent of Fitzhugh's social formula: “Marriage is too much like slavery not to be involved in its fate .... Slavery, marriage, religion, are the pillars of the social fabric [and are in) intimate connexion and dependence ..." (qtd. Genovese 198). This kind of marriage between family life and slavery is a natural one for Frankenstein. Once Frankenstein finds the secret of life, he rhapsodizes about his future scientific paternity, reproducing the dynamic of domination and obligation that characterized his relationship to his parents: “A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as IMonstrous Adventures in Domesticity 211 should deserve theirs" (58, my emphasis). Frankenstein models his scientific family on a dialectic of affectionate obligation. And difference seems to be a narrative prerequisite for the domestic family. Shelley uses a similar kind of menacing, possessive affection to characterize nearly all the novel's familial relations. Frankenstein views his adopted sister and future bride as a possession: He says "[I] looked upon Elizabeth as mine – mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own ... No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me — my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only” (44). Frankenstein's obsessive repetitions, "mine - mine,” recall Fitzhugh's slave owner who, like Frankenstein, loves his objectified subordinate because of her subordination. Remember Fitzhugh's words: “He loves them because they are his” (70). And like the slave owner, Frankenstein expects to own anything of value belonging to the subordinated subject (“All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own"). Frankenstein may not be able to birth a child, but he realizes the power of language to "body forth” — to birth — the nature of familial relations, a realization his scientific son inherits. The Monster also uses the language of domestic obligation when he tries to join in the family fold: “Remember that I am thy creature" (93). And the Monster's affections are just as menacing as his creator's. He clearly spells out the social contract of domestic affection: "If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes ... I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded” (130). The Monster most overtly extends the dynamic of domestic obligation beyond the family to the larger society. In one of many rebukes, the Monster reminds Frankenstein that domestic212 Adventures in Domesticity affections are of national importance. “How dare you thus sport with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind” (93). In so saying, he mouths Fitzhugh's “theory of the moral influences of slavery,” which, as I said above, is enacted through domestic ties. Here is Fitzhugh on the moral benefits of slavery to the slave: A consciousness of security, a full comprehension of his position, and a confidence in that position, and the absence of all corroding cares and anxieties, makes the slave easy and self-assured in his address, cheerful, happy and contented, free from jealousy, malignity, and envy, and at peace with all around him. His attachment to his master begets the sentiment of loyalty, than which none more purifies and elevates human nature. (65) By making Frankenstein and her readers sympathetic to the Monster's claim that he is a virtual slave and outcast because Frankenstein fails to fulfill his familial duty, Shelley endorses the logic of familial obligation. Frankenstein is “moved” by the Monster's supplication for a female companion: “I felt there was some justice in his argument. His tale, and the feelings he now expressed, proved him to be a creature of fine sensations; and did I not, as his maker, owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow?" (129). But ultimately Frankenstein is unable to “sympathize" with the “filthy mass that moved and talked,” concluding that domestic homes and nations do not owe “justice” to (racialized) others (131) This marriage of economic and sentimental discourses was largely a development of nineteenth-century racialist discourse. Earlier, seventeenth- and early-eighteenth-century writers discoursed about slavery in primarily economic terms;Monstrous Adventures in Domesticity 213 cultural difference was still an ancillary justification. By positing domestic affection as the basis for the health of the slave economy, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British and American writers established what Said has termed a "structure of feeling” that naturalized and domesticated what had been a viewed primarily as an economic condition. Forerunning Victorian and nineteenth-century ideology of the family, Shelley suggests that to secure a place within the domestic family is to secure a place within the family of Man and to participate in the civilized social order. She makes this equation foundational to the Monster's education. When the Monster eyes into the domestic circle of the deLacey cottage family, he is schooled in the history of empires and in the ways of nineteenth-century Europe: the strange system of human society was explained to me. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty; of rank, descent, and noble blood ... I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches ... without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave. (109) Onto the monstrous tabula rasa Shelley inscribes the rules of society. The Monster learns that the world is organized according to rules of genealogy and adulteration. A nation can survive only if its citizens reproduce "unsullied" heirs. The Monster is a quick study, applying this formula to his personal status: “The words induced me to turn towards myself ... Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man" (109,214 Adventures in Domesticity my emphasis). Without genealogical privilege or property, the Monster has no way to enter into the social mechanism. Marxist critics have read his predicament as an economic one, calling the Monster a disenfranchised worker without access to the base. But from a postcolonial perspective, we could extend that argument to say that the Monster's racialized appearance reduces him to the status of slave who experiences what Orlando Patterson has called “social death." Marxist readings are compelling, but the novel's obsessive focus on the Monster's “filthy resemblance" to Man suggests an overlap of class and race difference in his adulterated genealogy. Indeed, the Monster fears he will be "disowned” by “man” (109) because of his lack of paternal and propertied inheritance — but also because he is physically illegitimate. As with the eponymous Creole figure in Cumberland's The West Indian and with Fanny Price in Austen's Mansfield Park, the Monster's threat to the social body is emplotted into a domestic narrative that has far- reaching social importance; the Monster can be a social being only if he is legitimately adopted into Frankenstein's domestic circle. But unlike Belcour in The West Indian, the Monster cannot be converted. Rather, in a kind of reverse genealogical move, his adulteration threatens to infect his father and the whole domestic nation. I have been arguing that the novel's dialectic of domestic obligation is underwritten by metaphors of domination. As the Monster becomes more educated and more rebuffed by Frankenstein, the language of domination becomes more specifically the language of slavery. But it is unclear who enslaves whom. Frankenstein sees himself as “belonging to a race of human beings like myself" (147), while both Frankenstein and his monster view the Monster's differences as that of a “new species” (58, passim). But, while Fitzhugh would have seen their master-slave relationship as eminently social, both Frankenstein and the Monster are isolated fromMonstrous Adventures in Domesticity 215 society, Frankenstein because he is a slave to science, and the Monster because of his difference or "filthy resemblance” to Man. Frankenstein works in self-imposed exile: "I shunned my fellow creatures” (60). Frankenstein includes himself in the fellowship of man, suggesting that difference from that fellowship precludes participation in the social order. But although Frankenstein, as paternal creator, ought to have the right to domination, according to the novel's logic of domestic relations, he is enslaved and exiled by his monstrous domestic obligations. The creation of the Monster's bride transforms him: “I appeared ... like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines” (60). He repeatedly says “I was the slave of my creature” (135). Likewise, once the Monster realizes he will have no “community” (94) with his creator, he too engages the language of slavery and domination to coerce and debase Frankenstein. Finding that Frankenstein has mangled his bride, the Monster excoriates his maker: “Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy or my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master; obey!” (146). Frankenstein understands this plea since he too extends the metaphors of possession and obligation to include the family of man. When, for instance, Frankenstein decides to destroy the Monster's future bride, it is because he views her as the most dangerous family relation. Her potential lust for man over monster could, Frankenstein fears, threaten “the existence of the whole human race" (145). Like his monster, Frankenstein uses a negative model of obligation to guide his action, for only in mutilation does she take on human characteristics: “The remains of the half- finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being ... [I] cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the216 Adventures in Domesticity spot” (148). His act of violence resituates him within the family of man: “When I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself" (147). Here, family, like domestic, resonates with two meanings: the family home and the family of man. Ironically, it is from his illegitimacy and disenfranchisement that the Monster draws his power and reverses the terms of domination. The Monster chides his maker: “I had feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn. Man! you may hate; but beware! ... Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful!” (146). Spinning magnetically around this dialectic, the distinction between man and monster begins to erode. But the Monster is no dummy. He intuits Hegel's master-slave dialectic with respect to the family, and realizes that while outsiders are marginalized by their outsider status, boundaries fluctuate and power changes hands. By the time the Monster appeals to Frankenstein for a bride, he is aware of the force of such rhetoric. He demands recognition and recompense for Frankenstein's failure to fulfill his obligation: “You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being ... I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede” (128). Their talk of “rights” and obligations refers to the social contract of the family, nation, and world since both man and monster see the bride's creation as having more than personal consequence. At first, Frankenstein petulantly refuses, exclaiming wildly, "shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world? Begone!" (128). But the Monster retorts in the rhetoric of slavery and Enlightenment reason. He assures Frankenstein that “benevolence" and "reason” would secure the Monster's kindness and social usefulness, whereas Frankenstein's “passion[ate)” refusal will spell destruction:Monstrous Adventures in Domesticity 217 Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of your birth. (128-29) Shelley uses the word union to describe both marriage and social ties — and when the obligations toward either union is abrogated, the result is disastrous. For one, the passage calls to mind the numerous Caribbean slave revolts of the eighteenth century, contemporary labor protests, and anticipates the slave insurrections of the nineteenth century, like those led by Nat Turner. It also, of course, calls to mind the French, American, and Haitian revolutions, the language and ideologies of which Shelley was very familiar. But the threat is also personal, and Frankenstein's initial refusal to birth a bride is all the more foolish since he understands the dual nature of domestic threats. But while domestic obligation seems to end in ruin, domestic affection has the power to emancipate and restore social order. Frankenstein views his marriage as reward for discharging his debt to the Monster: "For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils — one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of the day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her" (135). To drink from the cup of domestic bliss is to sip218 Adventures in Domesticity lethian waters since, for Frankenstein at least, domestic happiness is amnesiatic. In the end, Frankenstein fails to save the domestic family, the domestic nation, and even his domestic narrative from the force of adulterating difference. In the diary that narrates Frankenstein's labors to birth his creature, we hear that he “minutely describe[s] ... every step [he] took in the progress of [his] work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences” (117). Frankenstein's two families - the legitimate and the illegitimate — are related in narrative and in action. One forceful instance is the way Frankenstein's duty toward his illegitimate child precludes the fulfillment of his marriage to Elizabeth. Frankenstein must produce a bride for the Monster before he can marry: “I must perform my engagement and let the Monster depart with his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delights of a union from which I expected peace" (134). So entwined are Frankenstein's and the Monster's marital unions that even the word used to describe his agreement to create a bride is a wedding word: engagement. But Frankenstein never gets past his engagements. The Monster's wedding preparation stalls and ultimately substitutes for Frankenstein's legitimate union. For, the Monster's famous threat “I shall be with you on your wedding night” (147) is the threat of substituting monstrous for pure domesticity. Because Frankenstein and the Monster murder each other's brides, the living wedding party consists of two frustrated, bloodlusty grooms: “I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed toward the corpse of my wife" (168).' Frankenstein and the Monster are the united couple bonded by their desire for mutual destruction. Indeed there is no legitimate consummation on the wedding night, no natural reproduction. There is only the “filthy process” of Frankenstein's “labour," an adulterated parturition thatMonstrous Adventures in Domesticity 219 transforms Frankenstein's legitimate domestic home into teratological terrain: "now misery has come home and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other's blood” (134). Rather than having been “disowned” (109) from the family of man because of his dismembered humanity, the Monster insists on altering the nature of familial relations. Frankenstein has lost the battle against adulteration. Men are now monsters, revenge has replaced love, and illegitimate scientific production has precluded legitimate reproduction. Most important to this argument, however, is that as much as the wedding bedchamber scene is about failed domestic unions, it is also about adulteration and miscegenation. Recall that contemporary discourse of slavery utilized tropes of adulteration to talk about the trade and miscegenation. In chapter 3, I discussed abolitionist poets who called slavery a "contagion," a "corruption,” a “leprosy [that] taints” or “infects.” And as I demonstrated in chapter 2, antimiscegenation laws underwrote property and inheritance laws, racializing the sexual economy. Frankenstein's characterization of miscegenation as monstrous comes out of this popular racial discourse. As we have seen, the threat of adulteration looms large in Frankenstein. But his wedding night is not the first time Frankenstein worries about the consequences of miscegenation — or inter-"species" mixing. Indeed, it is not even the Monster who poses the greatest threat in Frankenstein's view. While contemplating the outcome of creating a monstrous bride, Frankenstein meditates upon the possibilities of such a union: He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation. They might even hate each other; the220 Adventures in Domesticity creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species. Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the daemon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror. Had I a right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race. (144-45, my emphasis) Like contemporary politicians, natural historians, planters, and journalists, Frankenstein fears that the corruption of domestic purity by adulterated female sexuality will destroy the social order. Consider only two (slightly) contemporary commentators on the subject of miscegenation. In his 1785 Notes on the State of Virgina, Thomas Jefferson argues for the deportation of all Africans and African-Americans on the basis of racial purity:Monstrous Adventures in Domesticity 221 Will not a lover of natural history, then, one who views the gradations in all the races of animals with the eye of philosophy, excuse an effort to keep those in the department of man as distinct as nature has formed them? ... Among the Romans emancipation required but one effort. The slave, when made free, might mix with, without staining the blood of his master. But with us a second is necessary, unknown to history. When freed, he is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture. Twenty years earlier, in the London Chronicle, an anonymous writer who called himself Anglicus wrote of the influx of black servants: “As they fill the places of so many of our own people, we are by this means depriving so many of them of the means of getting their bread, and thereby decreasing our native population in favour of a race, whose mixture with us is disgraceful” (qtd. in Freyer 155, my emphasis). As we have seen, Edward Long and others spelled out their fears about race mixing, developing related ideologies of racial purity and national identity. During a time when the narrative of English identity obsessed over tropes of purity, it should be unsurprising that Frankenstein sees his own narration as susceptible to corruption. He struggles to tell his tale to Walton: "My own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration” (169, my emphasis). And he fears for the purity of his textual issue: "since you have preserved my narration ... I would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity” (179, my emphasis). Unlike the narrator in Advantages of Education (see Introduction), Frankenstein is not able to use his narration as a safe proxy for conveying dangerous stories. His failure to domesticate the Monster and the Monster's success at222 Adventures in Domesticity adulterating domesticity render Frankenstein's narrative as tainted as his son. In my first chapter, we saw that the English Royal Society exhorted writers to aim for a “primitive purity” of narration. Frankenstein's concern with his "hideous," “mutilated” narration points out that more than one hundred years later, writers were still distracted by tropes and texts of purity and corruption. I have argued that the trope of colonial adulteration lurked at the boundaries of eighteenth-century English narrative and provided the terms in which the idea of English domesticity was conceived. I hope this study will provide a framework that will help us understand the way colonial England narrated its domestic stories and to see how the seemingly distant effects of the colonial enterprise extended to shape the national imaginary — but also its horizon, which serves as the boundary for purity and adulteration. Earlier, I said that I close this book with Frankenstein because the novel was published at an important juncture in English history. The power dynamics in the novel were informed by a turbulent century of rebellion. And the novel looks forward to continued revolt of slaves and workers. Frankenstein's Monster, a figure of race and class difference, speaks eloquently to England's fear of insurrection and adulteration. But in him — and as I began to discuss in chapter 4 — we also see the way in which representations of racial others begin to overlap with representations of workers. Nineteenth-century writers like William Cobbett mapped out social differences between the classes in ways that recall eighteenth-century African and Caribbean travelogues. Often, difference was located in the family. Moreover, the multiple layers of narration - especially the Monster's eloquent speeches — indicate that not only is the story of English identity changing but so too is the form of the story and the identity of the narrators.Monstrous Adventures in Domesticity 223 Notes Michel Foucault's concept of "docile bodies” can be found in Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison (New York: Random House, 1979). 2 Johanna M. Smith, ed. Frankenstein (New York: Bedford Books St. Martin's Press, 2000), 317. Several early, now standard feminist readings of Shelley's novel include: Gilbert and Gubar's “Horror's Twin: Mary Shelley's Monstrous Eve,” in Madwoman in the Attic (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1979); Barbara Johnson, “My Monster/ My Self” (Diacritics, 12:2 (1982), 2-10); Anne Mellor's “Possessing Nature: The Female in Frankenstein" in Romanticism and Feminism (Bloomington: Indiana Universtiy Press, 1988); and Mary Poovey, The Proper Lady and the Woman Writer (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995). This is a small list of early feminist essays that, from a variety of different perspectives, read out a split between public and private realms. More recently, see Johanna Smith, “Cooped Up': Feminine Domesticity in Frankenstein,” Frankenstein, ed. Smith; Kate Ferguson Ellis, “Subversive Surfaces: The Limits of Domestic Affection in Mary Shelley's Later Fiction" in The Other Mary Shelley, ed. Audrey A. Fisch, Anne K. Mellor, Esther H. Schor (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993); and Debra Best “A Monster in the Family: A Reconsideration of Frankenstein's Domestic Relationships.” Women's Writing 6 (1999): 365-384. For a recent, sharp analysis of scientific racism in the nineteenth century, see Robert Young, Colonial Desire: Hybridity in Theory, Culture and Race (New York: Routledge, 1995).224 Adventures in Domesticity See Edward Said, Culture and Imperialism (New York: Random House, 1994). s Most famous is Franco Moretti's Signs Taken for Wonders (New York: Verso, 1997), chapter 3, “Dialectic of Fear.” For a lucid, brief Marxist reading of the novel, see also Warren Montag, “The 'Workshop of Filthy Creation': A Marxist Reading of Frankenstein,” in Frankenstein ed. Smith. In Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and the Technology of Monsters (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1995), Judith Halberstam makes an interesting argument about gothic monstrosity in the context of generic criticism. An assumption of her argument is that: “Owner and worker relations, in other words, are precisely played out in family relations; the narrative of family is indeed the sentimentalized version, or in his case the gothicized version, of class struggle and race war" (30). 6 See Orlando Patterson, Slavery and Social Death (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982). Among the very few postcolonial readings of Frankenstein, H. L. Malchow's "Was Frankenstein's Monster 'a Man and a Brother'?” is notable. See Malchow's Gothic Images of Race in Nineteenth-Century Britain (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1996). He claims: A reading of this text that attempts to draw out an embedded racial message must begin where racism itself begins, with physiognomy. The Monster, it will be seen, is not merely a grotesque, a too-roughly cobbled-together simulacrum of a man. He is, first, larger and more powerful than his maker, and, second, dark and sinister in appearance. This suggests the standard description of the black man inMonstrous Adventures in Domesticity 225 both the literature of the West Indies and that of unfolding West African exploration. Mungo Park's Travels, which Mary Shelley had ready to hand, described the Mandingoes as “commonly above the middle size, well-shaped, strong, and capable of enduring great labour." A Negro guide who "mounted up the rocks, where indeed no horse could follow him, leaving me to admire his agility,” indicates both great strength, and perhaps the simian dexterity with which the Monster eludes Frankenstein in the Alps. The Jamaican Bryan Edwards described the Mandingoes as “remarkably tall,” while the Eboes were, he averred, a sickly yellow in complexion with eyes that appeared to be “suffused with bile.” By the early nineteenth century, popular racial discourse managed to conflate such descriptions of particular ethnic characteristics into a general image of the Negro body in which repulsive features, brutelike strength and size of limbs featured prominently. Frankenstein's creature, when we first see him, is defined by a set of clichés that might be picked out of such literature. His eyes are “dull yellow” and "watery,” hair “a lustrous black” and “ragged,” and his black lips contrast with "teeth of pearly whiteness.” His skin was “in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy.” (18) See also Joseph Lew, “The Deceptive Other: Mary Shelley's Critique of Orientalism in Frankenstein,” Studies in Romanticism 20.2 (Summer 1991) and Zoreh T.
