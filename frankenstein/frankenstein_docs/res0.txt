A Critical History of Frankenstein I began the Critical History for the 1992 ﬁrst edition of this book by noting the increase in academic criticism of Frankenstein after 1970 or so. Updating that Critical History for this edition, I found an even more striking increase: of the more than four hundred entries under “Mary Shelley Frankenstein” recently listed in the on-line MLA Bibli- ography, over half were published after 1990. Not surprisingly, the foci of criticism have shifted too. Prior to 1970, most critics discussed Mary Shelley rather than her novel; nonbiographical criticism did focus on the novel, but as a subset of a more signiﬁcant category such as Roman- ticism, as a minor incident in some majofand predominantly masculine literary tradition. After 1970 critical attention interrogated both Franken:tein’s ﬁt in established literary traditions and the status of those traditions themselves, with feminist critics in particular asking why women writers had been excluded from the Romantic canon. But feminist criticism itself tended to exclude considerations of class and race in the novel, and one of the most interesting developments of post- l99O Frankenstein criticism is a new attention to those issues. Another shift in critical focus, which like the ﬁrst began around 1970 and took a slightly different turn after 1990, has to do with whether the novel had attained high-culture status. As the post-1970 critique of the Romantic canon paralleled a more general tendency in literary studies to analyze how and why literature canons are constructed, so the new attention to 137238 A CRITICAL HISTORY Frankenstein as a ﬁt subject for academic criticism paralleled a reevalua- tion of popular culture as similarly available to scholarly analysis. From this perspective, what is striking about post-1990 Frankenstein criticism is an increased attention from practitioners not only of haute critique, especially deconstruction, but also of cultural studies; in other words, the novel remains a ﬁt in both high and low culture. In what follows I trace in more detail these and other shifts in the critical history of Frankenstein. I track these shifts chronologically, by noting those that began around 1970 and those that have occurred since 1990. I also attempt to prepare for the critical methodologies exempliﬁed in Part II of this book, by showing how the Frankenstein criticism using those methodologies developed from earlier criticism. Mary Shelley’s ﬁrst critic was her husband Percy. Although his essay “On Frankenstein” wasn’t published until 1832 (ten years after his death), it was written in 1817 and apparently intended to counter potentially hostile reviews. This intention is somewhat disingenuous, for Percy’s feigned ignorance of the identity of Frankenstein’s author masks his own contributions to the novel. Nonetheless, his review raises two issues that persist in later criticism. The ﬁrst is a question: Who is responsible for the monster’s monstrosity? For Percy, the novel’s “direct moral” (264) is that “you”— us, society — created the mon- ster: “divide . . . a social being from society, and you impose upon him the irresistible obligations [of] malevolence and selﬁshness”; more sim- ply, “[t]reat a person ill, and he will become wicked.” But Percy also suggests that no one can ﬁnally be held responsible. The creature’s crimes are not “the offspring of an unaccountable propensity to evil,” so they are not his fault, but neither are they the fault of Victor Frankenstein: rather they are “the children, as it were, of necessity and human nature.” Applied to a novel that conspicuously bypasses the usual reproductive process, this language of “offspring” and “children” is suggestive: as it implies that “necessity” and “human nature” birthed a monster, it exonerates the father-creator Victor. As early as 1824, however, one commentator insisted that Victor “ought to have re- ﬂected on the means of giving happiness to the being of his creation” instead of abusing the creature for “crimes to which his [own] negli- gence gave rise” (“The Anniversary” 199), and many later critics con- tinued to ﬁnd Victor responsible for the creature’s misdeeds. Criticism has also pursued the second issue raised in Percy’s review, the ways that sensational ﬁction might (mis)educate its readers. After praising Frankenstein as “a source of powerful and profound emotion”A CRITICAL HISTORY 239 (263), Percy distinguishes between feeling and rational responses to those emotions. The reader interested in “anything beside[s] a new love-story” will “feel a responsive string touched” by the “elementary feelings” that are the novel’s subject; only the reader “accustomed to reason deeply” on the “origin and tendency” of such feelings, however, can “sympathize, to the full extent,” with the events they produce. Here we have three levels of reader: those interested only in love sto- ries; those capable of vibrating in sympathy with emotions other than the romantic; and those, fit audience though few, capable of reasoned and therefore full sympathy. This last readership, the “you” whose responses and reason are educated by reading the novel, should thus become capable of grasping its “direct moral.” But nineteenth-century commentators were divided about Frankenstein's moral effect. Many early reviewers, less sanguine than Percy, felt the emotions stirred by the novel would feed sensation rather than education. In 1818 John Cro- ker sputtered over the novel’s “tissue of horrible and disgusting absur- dity” (382) and concluded that it would please only readers with “deplorably vitiated” tastes (385), since it “fatigues the feelings with- out interesting the understanding” and “inculcates no lesson of con- duct, manners, or morality.” Another early reviewer admired the novel’s “harsh and savage delineations of passion” (“Review” 249) but faulted its “gloomy views of nature and of man, bordering too closely on impiety,” and also feared it would appeal to an already “desperately inflamed . . . appetite . . . for every sort of wonder”; most troubling was “the expression “Creator, applied to a mere human being” (253), for “wild and irregular theories” of this sort may shock “some of our highest and most reverential feelings.” Concerns about Frankenstein's moral effects persisted among crit- ics. In 1844, Richard Horne stressed that the novel “teaches the tragic results of . . . an impetuous irresistible passion” (228); the fact that those results are “the great ministry of Pain” from which “humanity rises purified” suggests that for Horne the novel teaches its lessons by operating on the reader's feelings. In 1886, however, the Reverend Hugh Haweis admitted to “some degree of hesitation” about reissuing a horror story whose “moral thrust — if there is any – is vague and indeterminate” (5–6). As these writers emphasize the novel’s effects on its reader, they show the importance nineteenth-century high culture attached to the formation of popular taste. This is why the popular appeal of Frankenstein's Gothic horror struck early critics as significant: the reader’s moral sense might be formed to good or (like the crea- ture's) deformed by undisciplined indulgence in sensation. ---240 A CRITICAL HISTORY M. A. Goldberg’s 1959 article was among the ﬁrst modern in- terpretations to recover this sense of Frankenstein’s moral purpose. In her view, the horror-story elements that so troubled Haweis were inte- gral to the novel’s moral: Frankenstein’s “moral context” was the eighteenth-century aesthetic that taking “pleasure in terror” has “ethi- cal and social implications” (28-29), and so the terror Frankenstein inspires was meant to instill its moral lesson. Since 1990 there has been a new critical attention to the “ethical and social implications” of teach- ing such lessons, in other words of pedagogy itself. Maureen McLane reads the novel as “a parable of pedagogic failure” (959), the failure of “the promise of the humanities . . . as a route to humanization.” Alan Richardson argues that Frankenstein shows how an education “predi- cated on inequality” (157) is “a form of tyranny,” while Anne McWhir uses the novel to suggest that a teacher “recogniz[e] her own role as oppressor — manipulating texts for authoritarian ends — as well as her own sympathy” with the oppressed (86-87). Another problematic indicated by nineteenth-century commenta- tors and revived by M. A. Goldberg is Frankenstein’s cultural status. By relocating the novel in its social context, Goldberg reconciled its popular elements with its high moral seriousness, thereby closing a gap between low-culture and high-culture status. Frankenstein then re- ceived the academic imprimatur with an MLA Approaches to Teaching volume in 1990 and Mary Lowe-Evans’s Twayne book in 1993. But the question of Frankenstein’s status has remained vexed, in part because of the novel’s prodigious popularity. It has been reprinted in dozens of English-language editions and translated into Iapanese, Ara- bic, Urdu, Malayam, and most European languages; the 1942 Armed Services and overseas editions were clearly aimed at a popular audience, as were the 1945 comic book and the many “simpliﬁed” versions designed for children; and the story’s appeal is further evidenced in the number of nineteenth-century melodramas and twentieth-century hor- ror movies based (however loosely) on the novel. This popularity has continued unabated in the 1990s: as I write, I have before me the Topps Comics ofﬁcial adaptation of Kenneth Branagh’s Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, the Wishbone Classics Frankenstein as retold by Michael Burgan, an Absolut Shelley vodka ad, a collection of stories and novel- las entitled The Mammoth Book of Frankenstein, and an article on “Frankenstein as Founding Myth in Gary Larson’s The Far Side.” That article appeared in the academic ]0urnal of Popular Culture in 1994, only ﬁfteen years after the ﬁrst collection of academic criticism on Frankenstein. In their preface to the collection, George Levine andA CRITICAL HISTORY 241 U. C. Knoepﬂmacher had evinced some unease at applying “the ‘high seriousness’ of the Arnoldian literary critic” (xii) to Frankenstein; their tone is half-joking, but it does indicate the difﬁculties of attempting both to account for Frankenstein’s “persistent hold” on the popular imagination and to “rescue” it for high culture from the abyss of low culture. One early branch of “rescue” criticism established an impeccable high-culture pedigree for Mary Shelley’s novel by taking her philosoph- ical and political ideas seriously. In 1965 Burton Pollin demonstrated Frankenstein’s “respectable philosophical intent” (108) by analyzing the monster’s education in terms of Iohn Locke’s Essay concerning Human Understanding and Etienne Bonnot de Condillac’s Treatise on Sensations. Criticism after 1970 increasingly compared Mary’s political ideas with those of her father William Godwin, and this work by Katherine Powers and Lee Sterrenburg was continued after 1990. Gre- gory Maertz, for instance, sees Frankenstein as appropriating and rewriting Godwin’s novel St. Leon, while Marilyn May suggests a more anxious intertextual relation between Mary’s work and her father’s. After 1970, some scholars based claims for Frankenstein’s high- culture status on its literary rather than its philosophical lineage. Taking their cue f'om the novel’s subtitle, critics such as William Hildebrand read Victor as a Promethean overreacher, while in 1973 L. I. Swingle situated Mary Shelley in the Romantic tradition by virtue of her con- cern with the problem of knowledge. Such readings located Franken- stein in a masculine literary tradition reaching from Aeschylus’s Prometheus Bound to Percy Shelley’s Prometheus Unbound, a strategy that often amounted to hooking a popular novel by a woman to a train of literary classics by men. As early as 1967, however, P. D. Fleck con- tended that Mary’s novel was in fact critiquing the idealism of much Romantic literature, and this critical trend has continued. After 1970 critics such as Iohn Reed, Iames O’Rourke, and Elsie B. Michie argued for Mary’s “resistance to Romanticism” (Michie 32); by the 1990s a plethora of studies was linking Mary with women Romantic writers (Stephen Behrendt) and also stressing her departures from masculine Romantic ideas about creativity (Mary Favret, “Letters,” and Ierome Bump), incest (Leila May), education (Richardson), linguistic develop- ment (Christian Bok), and autobiography (Richard Lansdown). Also in the 1990s, the Mary Shelley once seen as a hanger-on of Romanticism is being reevaluated as a precursor of literary ﬁgures from Ivan Turgenev (Richard Freeborn) to Doris Lessing (Norma Rowen, “Frankenstein”). As early as 1973, of course, Mary was already being242 A CRITICAL HISTORY touted by Brian Aldiss as a precursor of the new genre of science fiction. In 1981 Judith Spector gave this claim a feminist twist by calling Mary the mother of science fiction, and in 1991 Jenny Newman connected Mary to modern feminist science fiction writers. While Barry Crawford is testy about “feminist interpretations” of Frankenstein (154) that “attempt to domesticate science fiction,” other 1990s scholars of sci- ence fiction such as George Slusser are less defensive; indeed, Reuben Ellis claims Frankenstein for the form of science fiction known as specu- lative fiction. And it seems fitting that science fiction, itself located somewhere between escapist trash and serious commentary, should find a forerunner in Frankenstein. Alongside these claims for Frankenstein's importance to science fic- tion, however, were continued arguments for the novel’s high-culture status. Although it was the first book of an inexperienced writer, many post-1970s critics found in Frankenstein no simple tale of schlock hor- ror but a complex narrative technique and a sophisticated understand- ing of the problems of interpretation. For Gay Clifford, Frankenstein’s technique of first-person narration demonstrates the three narrators’ solipsism and thereby avoids the “Romantic cliché” of lonely alienation (604); for Richard Dunn, the novel’s three-narrative form “structurally dramatizes the failure of human community” (408); for Beth Newman, Frankenstein’s frame structure and embedded stories show the inade- quacy of conventional modes of interpretation. In the 1990s many claims for the novel’s literary sophistication are made in high-theory modes. Thomas Dutoit reads the creature through Michel Foucault’s theorization of the body as spectacle, while Ellen Goldner works insightfully with Foucault's theories of discipline as well as spectacle. Readings also exfoliate from deconstruction’s interest in différance/ deferral (Jerrold Hogle), supplements (Bok) and traces (Bernard Duyf- huizen), figuration (Steven Vine, “Filthy”), and monstrosity (Peter Brooks, “What,” and Fred Botting). Critical methods adapted from psychoanalytic theory during the 1970s were concerned less with Frankenstein's literary merit than with its characters, its author, and its structure. Morton Kaplan saw in Victor a son’s classic oedipal desire to displace the father and marry the mother, and in the monster a return of Victor’s repressed desire for and hatred of the mother. In these Freudian terms the creature, Vic- tor's doppelgänger or double, is the id (instinctual self) repressed by the ego (conscious self) but escaping to act out the ego's subconscious desires; his accusation against Justine thus enacts Victor's irrational anger against a too-seductive mother. U. C. Knoepflmacher called theA CRITICAL HISTORY 143 novel “a fantasy designed to relieve [Mary’s] deep personal anxieties” about her relations to her parents (92), while I. M. Hill interpreted it as a Freudian “family romance” of Victor’s incestuous desire for a mother’s exclusive love, and thus as Mary Shelley’s attempt to detach herself by “authorial otherness” from her own obsessive desire for a mother’s love (339-40). In a contrasting Freudian reading, Marc Rubenstein saw Mary as searching for an origin in her mother via “an endlessly repeated reenactment of primal scene observation” (178). Some readings applied Freudian concepts to the novel’s struc- ture. Kaplan compared Frankenstein’s Gothic horror form to a night- mare, and Daniel Cottom read the narrative’s careful organizing structure as a Freudian displacement of repressed disorder. For Ioseph Kestner, the novel’s tale-within-a-tale structure was a kind of narcis- sism, the pathological egoism that turns the outer world of Others into a mirror of the self; as each tale and narrator reﬂects the others, they reveal Walton’s and especially Victor’s isolation and self-absorption. In the 1990s Freudian readings move away from character, author, and narrative structure to more theoretical concerns. Steven Vine’s “Hellish Sport” analyzes the novel in terms of Freud’s joke theory, the essays by Christine Berthin and Ruth Parkin-Gounelas “modulate the canonical deﬁnition of the [Freudian] ‘uncanny’ ” (Berthin 31), and Iudith Pike’s elegant reading of the creature as fetishized corpse draws on Freudian but also on Lacanian concepts. Much post-1970s psychoanalytic criticism of Frankenstein bor- rowed from Lacanian theory, and in the 1990s Lacanian readings con- tinue to be a growth industry. Iacques Lacan postulated that when an infant enters the Imaginary order it begins to conceive of its self as a self, to become a subject; but it also retains an anxious sense of its now lost undifferentiation, of its lost union with the mother. If all goes well, however, as it enters the Symbolic order the infant comes to accept the dominion of what Lacan calls the Law of the Father; now it learns to bring its subjectivity into synch with the complex of social constructs that structure its relations with others and with its culture. One of these constructs is language, and Peter Brooks’s 1979 Lacanian reading has been very inﬂuential in the 1990s, especially his use of the concept of “language as relation” (208) to analyze the novel’s failures of commu- nication. Ierrold Hogle and Gerhard Ioseph, for instance, reference Brooks as they discuss Frankenstein in terms of the Lacanian linguistic turn, the idea that the unconscious is structured like a language, and Iohn Lamb takes off from Brooks in his analysis of the monster’s “fall into language” (311). Both Diana Negra and Rhonda Kercsmar read244 A CRITICAL HISTORY Victor in terms of a problematic suggested by Lacanian theory, that of a split or fragmented subjectivity resulting from a failure to fully enter the Symbolic order. Another problematic suggested by Lacan, women’s exclusion from or refusal to enter the Symbolic order, can serve as a segue to feminist criticism of Frankenstein. This sizable and growing body of readings has provided instructive re-visions of many earlier sites of criticism: Mary Shelley’s relations with her parents and her husband; evaluations both of Frankenstein as a literary text and of its thematics; the utility of other critical methodologies when turned to a woman’s text; most gen- erally, all the ramiﬁcations of the fact that the novel was written by a woman. Frankenstein was ﬁrst published anonymously, and most early re- viewers assumed it was written by a man; in 1818, for instance, Walter Scott attributed it to Percy Shelley (614). In 1824 “The Anniversary” scouted this idea (188), but some seventy years later Richard Garnett detected Percy’s inﬂuence in the novel: Frankenstein was far superior to anything Mary Shelley wrote after her husband’s death, he explained, because “her brain, magnetized by his companionship, was capable of an effort never to be repeated” (v). But Florence Marshall, a contempo- rary of Garnett, reversed these magnetic poles by claiming that Percy Shelley’s achievements were due “in great measure” (1.2) to his wife’s “sustaining and reﬁning inﬂuence” (2.325); similarly, Helen Moore, another contemporary, saw Mary’s marital and literary bond with Percy as “complementary” (l1) and thus “truly womanly.” While Marshall’s and Moore’s are feminist statements, they exemplify the limited or domestic feminism in which women’s roles and qualities are highly val- ued but severely restricted to the domestic and “complementary.” The result is a sort of push-pull effect; even as Marshall claimed that “to love [Percy] Shelley adequately” was “a vocation, a career” (2.317), for instance, she also admitted that Mary’s “free growth” as a writer was “checked” by her marriage. Written at a time when women’s domestic roles and marriage itself were being reevaluated, these comments pre- ﬁgure some of the concerns of feminist criticism during another period of reevaluation, the 1970s. Feminist critics of the 1970s and 1980s revised many earlier judg- ments of Frankenstein’s author, and these readings are in turn being revised in the 1990s. Earlier critics had postulated that Percy Shelley’s revisions of and additions to the novel made him a “minor collabora- tor” (Rieger xviii), “though always in keeping with Mary’s conception” (Murray 67); against this view, in 1988 Anne Mellor assembled a bodyA CRITICAL HISTORY 1-45 of evidence from the early manuscript versions to argue that Percy often seriously misrepresented Mary’s intentions (and in 1996 Charles Robinson’s introduction to the Frankenstein manuscripts corrected all three of these judgments). Attention to William Godwin’s and Percy Shelley’s inﬂuence on Mary yielded to emphasis on her critique of (Sterrenburg) and departures from (Peter Dale Scott) those masculine inﬂuences. New attention was given to her relations with her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft: in 1976 Ianet Todd traced the parallels between Mary’s ﬁction and her mother’s, in 1979 Ellen Moers used Mary’s experience of her mother (who died giving birth to her) to read Frankenstein as “a horror story of maternity” (85), and in the 1990s Rhonda Batchelor and Elisabeth Bronfen analyzed the effects of Woll- stonecraft’s ﬁction and politics on her daughter. Post-1970s feminist attention to l’écriture feminine and to con- structing a history of women’s literature began to rewrite earlier views of Frankenstein as a literary text. Critics now saw the novel’s narrative structure as feminine and feminist: for Devon Hodges, Frankenstein critiques a masculine narrative pattern of sequence and closure intended to master the text; for Iames Carson, the three male narrators are a woman’s commentary on “the male expropriation of the voice of the conventionally passive female” (435); for Mary Poovey, the novel’s three narratives are a network of relations that allowed the author to efface but also to express her unladylike wish for literary fame. Several 1990s critics continue this new emphasis on the subversiveness of Frankenstein’s narrative structure. Iames Davis discerns three women’s stories that “ironically mirror” (308) the three men’s stories in which they are embedded; Susan Winnett sees the novel’s narrative pattern as a critique of “ending and sense making” (510); Ioyce Zonana uses Saﬁe’s absent letters to argue that Frankenstein is “an articulated frame surrounding a speaking silence” (180) and as such resists “the act of appropriation which is reading.” Another element of Poovey’s work has been especially inﬂuential: her analysis of the 1831 revisions was picked up by Henriette Power in 1988, and again by 1990s feminist readings that see in Mary’s 1831 introduction her desire to be “acknowledged as the novel’s ultimate author” (Leader 186). Feminists have placed and replaced Frankenstein in several literary histories. Against critics such as Ronald Paulson who located the novel in a masculine tradition of the Gothic novel, Moers in 1979 called it a female Gothic, Marcia Tillotson in 1983 explored the implications of that new alignment, and Richard- son in 1991 linked Frankenstein to the domestic novel as well as the fe- male Gothic. Source studies have changed direction too. Where Stuartz46 A CRITICAL HISTORY Curran saw the echoes of Paradise Lost in Frankenstein as relatively straightforward, in 1979 Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar argued that the novel dramatizes “the blind rejection of women by misogynistic/ Miltonic patriarchy” (243), and in 1991 Stephanie Kiceluk problema- tized that argument by pointing to Mary’s “repudiation” but also “assimilation” of Milton’s misogyny (1 12-13). Several of Frankenstein’s thematics were re-evaluated by feminist criticism in the 1970s and again in the 1990s (Rose). Earlier emphasis on the issue of creation shifted to analyses of procreation. In 1972 Robert Kiely argued that Victor’s presumption was not his Promethean usurpation of divine creativity but rather his unnatural “attempt to usurp the power of woman” to create life (165), and in 1995 David del Principe made a similar point about Victor’s “patrilineal erasure of the womb” (13); by the 1990s, then, the centrality of procreation to Frankenstein had been “virtually established” (Sanderson 49). Kiely’s domestic-feminist assumption that women are somehow “naturally” maternal, however, has also been critiqued: Moers called Frankenstein “most feminine” (85) when it expresses a mother’s “revulsion against newborn life” (81), and in 1982 both Mary Iacobus and Barbara Iohn- son saw in the novel “the unresolvable contradictions inherent in being female” (Iohnson 9). Much of the subsequent critical attention to those contradictions addressed the novel’s representations of domestic- ity as necessary yet somehow “inadequate” to its tasks (Goodwin 93). In 1979 Kate Ellis argued that the three narrators’ tales dramatize the deﬁciencies of the bourgeois family; in 1990 Marcia Aldrich and Richard Isomaki called attention to the novel’s “extreme” and “unrec- onciled” examples of both “masculine egotism” and “idealized domes- ticity” (124-25); in 1993 Vanessa Dickerson pointed to the number of women characters who “nurture and love unto death” (85), while Siobhan Craig and Nancy Fredricks later noted such characters’ difﬁ- culties in achieving subjectivity. Finally, feminist criticism has added to earlier critical methodologies and opened a way for new ones. I have already cited the additions to source studies and to narratology; the work just noted on the problem- atic of women’s subjectivity enriches the feminist/Lacanian analyses done in the 1980s by Margaret Homans, Rosemary Iackson, and Elissa Marder; and it is at least arguable that gender studies of Franken- stein built on the concerns of feminist criticism. William Veeder’s 1986 book turned feminist analyses of the concept of androgyny to Franken- stein’s constructions of gender; in 1993 Bette London applied feminist theories of specularity to the spectacle of masculinity in Franken-A CRITICAL HISTORY 247 stein, and Colleen Hobbs explored Victor’s masculine hysteria. By 1994, with Ludmilla Iordanova’s analysis of the gendering of science, Susan Stryker’s article “performing transgender rage” via Frankenstein, and Veronica Hollinger’s article about performing gender in the novel, gender studies was offering an impressive new body of work in Frankenstein criticism. The greatest growth in post-1990 criticism of the novel, however, has occurred in cultural studies. Of course, there was already a long his- tory of attention to Frankenstein movies—Donald Glut in 1973, Radu Florescu in 1975, Albert LaValley and William Nestrick in 1979, Patrick McLeod in 1980 — and this attention continued in the 1990s, with Steven Forry’s comprehensive study of Frankenstein adaptations (including texts of six plays) and with articles on mad scientist movies in general (Christopher Tuomey), on Frankenstein movies in particular (Robert Chamberlain, A. C. Goodson, Iames Heffernan), on cinematic and other visualizations of the monster (Iane Davidson), and on ﬁlmic and other variants of the text (myself ). Cultural criticism of Franken- stein in the 1980s included Iohn Rieder’s article on the cultural work of science ﬁction, Chris Baldick’s book on discursive forms of the Frankenstein monster in nineteenth-century culture, Alan Bewell’s groundbreaking comparison of Frankenstein’s language of obstetrics with that of eighteenth-century midwifery, and Gayatri Spivak’s read- ing of the novel as a text of “English cultural identity” (254). In 1993 Marie-Hélene Huet connected the novel’s monstrous birth to al- chemical and Renaissance writing on generation and monstrosity, and in 1996 Ionathan Glance placed Victor’s dreams in the context of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century dream theory. Several 1990s arti- cles followed Spivak in reformulating questions of cultural difference in Frankenstein — Vine (“Filthy”) analyzes gender difference, Margo Perkins class difference, and H. L. Malchow race difference — while Zonana, Ioseph Lew, Ieffrey Cass, and D. S. Neff used Edward Said’s concept of Orientalism to re-view Othering in the novel. The bull market in 1990s cultural criticism of Frankenstein is the new turn in studies of its science. Stephen Bann calls Frankenstein “a congeries of scientiﬁc and philosophical problems” (Introduction 1), and analyses of these problems have followed a revisionist course that mirrors changes in cultural views of science itself. In 1818 an anony- mous reviewer in Gentleman’s Magazine chastised “the pride of Science” with which Victor “presumes to take upon himself” the con- struction of a human being (334), and Walter Scott too disapproved of Victor’s “rash researches” (617) in “physiological discovery” (618).248 A CRITICAL HISTORY Later scholars took the novel’s science less seriously, considering it inac- curate pseudoscience. In 1976, however, Iohn Dussinger clariﬁed the importance of alchemical science to Victor’s endeavors, in 1984 Samuel Vasbinder defended Mary Shelley’s knowledge of early-nineteenth- century science, and in 1987 Sergio Perosa located Frankenstein in the context of a late-eighteenth-century hope that science and imagination might work together. Thereafter the terms of the debate shifted, as crit- ics came to see in the novel a critique of scientiﬁc claims to absolute knowledge and benevolent power. In line with a post-1960s reaction against war-related science and a post-1970s attention to bioethics, 1980s critics such as Theodore Ziolkowski and Ray Hammond empha- sized the novel’s representation of scientiﬁc irresponsibility and the consequences thereof. Mellor then read the novel as a feminist critique of masculine science, and Laura Kranzler argued that Victor’s creation of life and modern science’s sperm banks and artiﬁcial wombs show a similar “masculine desire to claim female (re)productivity for them- selves” (45). 1990s readings of the novel’s science follow some of these paths and branch out to others. Like Vasbinder, several critics place Frankenstein in a scientiﬁc context by linking Victor’s science to Rosi- crucian science (Marie Roberts), to Holbach’s System of Nature (McWhir), to radical (Marilyn Butler) and Romantic (Marina Ben- jamin) science, and to the debate in Romantic science over vitalism and materialism (Maurice Hindle, Martin Willis). Other critics see Franken- stein’s scientiﬁc context as one of transition, tension, and conﬂict: a transition from occult philosophy to modern science (David Ketterer, “Conversion”), or from “alchemical notions” (Vernon 271) to “the sci- entiﬁc principles of Chemistry and Physics”; a tension between natural magic and Enlightenment rationality (Crosbie Smith), or between alchemical and modern techniques of creation (Rowen, “Making”), or between secluded and social scientiﬁc work (Alan Rauch); a conﬂict between “ofﬁcial recognition of science” (Tim Marshall 6) and scien- tists’ “association with the gallows” in the popular mind. Some critics point to the failures of Victor’s science. The hope for unity between sci- ence and imagination that Perosa noted is shown by Michael Manson and Robert Stewart to have failed, while Carmine Sarracino examines that failure in light of a Vedic critique of Western dualistic science. Arti- cles by Favret follow up on earlier feminist critiques of masculinist sci- ence, and Kiceluk continues Kranzler’s critique of contemporary technology. That critique goes in a new direction with Iay Clayton, who connects Victor’s monster with analyses of the modern cyborg,A cRiiicAL HISTORY 249 and Mark Hansen, who reads Frankenstein as an example of “machinic textuality” (603). As Cecil Helman links the technologies of transplants and implants to the artiﬁcial man of both Frankenstein and late capitalism, his read- ing combines cultural criticism with the ﬁnal category of my history, Marxist criticism. Marxist readings of Frankenstein remain thin on the ground in the 1990s, but they continue to provide instructive re- visions of other criticism. As early as 1967, Stephen Crafts moved away from a still predominantly dismissive view of Frankenstein when he used Herbert Marcuse’s Marxist theory to parallel the oppressed and victimized monster with the “technologically oppressed” of industrial capitalism and with a Third World victimized by the First World (98). Where early psychoanalytical criticism saw the monster as Victor’s dop- pelganger, the Marxist concept of alienation offers an economic rather than psychological explanation for this relationship. Under capitalism the workers’ labor belongs not to them but to their employers, so that workers become alienated from their own labor and its products. This alienation produces what Marx called “misshapen” workers, and in 1983 Franco Moretti argued that the monster represents this deformed proletariat; in 1988 Michie saw both the monster and the novel as “objective products which alienate the artist/worker” (32). Other psy- choanalytic approaches were shifted by Marxist analysis from a personal to a political register. Instead of seeing Frankenstein’s family relations as Freudian incest fantasies, in 1983 Anca Vlasopolos interpreted Victor’s tendency toward incest as a form of class selection and exclusion; in 1991 Goodwin reworked another Freudian theory by reading the mon- ster as a ﬁgure for a psychological but also a “political uncanny” (104). Marxist criticism has also broadened feminist analyses of gender rela- tions in the novel: both Vlasopolos and Cottom analyze the class- speciﬁc traits that qualify only certain women for elevation into the Frankenstein family, and in 1983 Burton Hatlen saw in the novel a “revolutionary” (42) critique of class as well as gender hierarchies. In 1992 Lamb revised earlier source analyses when he called Frankenstein a “counter-hegemonic” text (308) “expos[ing] the illusory nature of bourgeois individualism” as set out in Paradise Lost (306). Among the strongest Marxist readings of Frankenstein, however, remains Paul O’Flinn’s 1983 claim that both the novel and the movie versions func- tion as “straightforward allegory” (199) of the class struggle. Each of the essays in this collection follows from the critical his- tory I have been sketching. David Collings’s piece reﬂects changes in250 A CRITICAL HISTORY psychoanalytic criticism of Frankenstein over the last ten years by exploring the relation between Lacanian theory and ideology critique. My essay in feminist criticism focuses on problematics of domesticity in conjunction with the related set of problematics posed by a gendered science. Frann Michel reads the novel from the perspective of gender studies to analyze hitherto underanalyzed elements of both Franken- stein’s women characters and feminist criticism’s attention to them. Warren Montag’s Marxist essay ﬁrst locates Frankenstein in history and then shows how history operates as a force within the text. Bouriana Zakharieva sees Kenneth Branagh’s ﬁlmic version of the novel as a symptom of cultural issues speciﬁc to the 1990s. Finally, Fred Botting’s essay exempliﬁes not a single critical methodology but rather the com- bination of methods that is so characteristic of contemporary literary criticism. As these essays’ various methodologies all converge on Frankenstein, they testify to the endurance of critical interest in Mary Shelley and her novel. WORKS CITED Aldiss, Brian.

It seems natural to think about novels in terms of dreams. Like dreams, literary works are ﬁctions, inventions of the mind that, although based on reality, are by deﬁnition not literally true. Like a lit- erary work, a dream may have some truth to tell, but, like a literary work, it may need to be interpreted before that truth can be grasped. We can live vicariously through romantic ﬁctions, much as we can through daydreams. Terrifying novels and nightmares affect us in much the same way, plunging us into an atmosphere that continues to cling, even after the last chapter has been read — or the alarm clock has sounded. The notion that dreams allow such psychic explorations, of course, like the analogy between literary works and dreams, owes a great deal to the thinking of Sigmund Freud, the famous Austrian psychoanalyst who in 1900 published a seminal essay, The Interpretation of Dreams. But is the reader who feels that Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights is dreamlike — who feels that Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is night- marish—necessarily a Freudian literary critic? To some extent the answer has to be yes. We are all Freudians, really, whether or not we have read a single work by Freud. At one time or another, most of us 262WHAT IS PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM? 263 have referred to ego, libido, complexes, unconscious desires, and sexual repression. The premises of Freud’s thought have changed the way the Western world thinks about itself. Psychoanalytic criticism has inﬂu- enced the teachers our teachers studied with, the works of scholarship and criticism they read, and the critical and creative writers we read as well. What Freud did was develop a language that described, a model that explained, a theory that encompassed human psychology. Many of the elements of psychology he sought to describe and explain are pres- ent in the literary works of various ages and cultures, from Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex to Shakespeare’s Hamlet to works being written in our own day. When the great novel of the twenty-ﬁrst century is written, many of these same elements of psychology will probably inform its dis- course as well. If, by understanding human psychology according to Freud, we can appreciate literature on a new level, then we should acquaint ourselves with his insights. Freud’s theories are either directly or indirectly concerned with the nature of the unconscious mind. Freud didn’t invent the notion of the unconscious; others before him had suggested that even the supposedly “sane” human mind was conscious and rational only at times, and even then at possibly only one level. But Freud went further, suggesting that the powers motivating men and women are mainly and normally unconscious. Freud, then, powerfully developed an old idea: that the human mind is essentially dual in nature. He called the predominantly pas- sional, irrational, unknown, and unconscious part of the psyche the id, or “it.” The ego, or “I,” was his term for the predominantly rational, logical, orderly, conscious part. Another aspect of the psyche, which he called the superego, is really a projection of the ego. The superego almost seems to be outside of the self, making moral judgments, telling us to make sacriﬁces for good causes even though self-sacriﬁce may not be quite logical or rational. And, in a sense, the superego is “outside,” since much of what it tells us to do or think we have learned from our parents, our schools, or our religious institutions. What the ego and superego tell us not to do or think is repressed, forced into the unconscious mind. One of Freud’s most important con- tributions to the study of the psyche, the theory of repression, goes something like this: much of what lies in the unconscious mind has been put there by consciousness, which acts as a censor, driving264 PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM underground unconscious or conscious thoughts or instincts that it deems unacceptable. Censored materials often involve infantile sexual desires, Freud postulated. Repressed to an unconscious state, they emerge only in disguised forms: in dreams, in language (so-called Freudian slips), in creative activity that may produce art (including lit- erature), and in neurotic behavior. According to Freud, all of us have repressed wishes and fears; we all have dreams in which repressed feelings and memories emerge dis- guised, and thus we are all potential candidates for dream analysis. One of the unconscious desires most commonly repressed is the childhood wish to displace the parent of our own sex and take his or her place in the affections of the parent of the opposite sex. This desire really involves a number of different but related wishes and fears. (A boy — and it should be remarked in passing that Freud here concerns himself mainly with the male — may fear that his father will castrate him, and he may wish that his mother would return to nursing him.) Freud referred to the whole complex of feelings by the word oedipal, naming the complex after the Greek tragic hero Oedipus, who unwittingly killed his father and married his mother. Why are oedipal wishes and fears repressed by the conscious side of the mind? And what happens to them after they have been censored? As Roy P. Basler puts it in Sex, Symbolism, and Psychology in Literature (1975), “from the beginning of recorded history such wishes have been restrained by the most powerﬁil religious and social taboos, and as a result have come to be regarded as ‘unnatural,’ ” even though “Freud found that such wishes are more or less characteristic of normal human development”: In dreams, particularly, Freud found ample evidence that such wishes persisted. . . . Hence he conceived that natural urges, when identiﬁed as “wrong,” may be repressed but not obliterated. . . . In the unconscious, these urges take on symbolic garb, regarded as nonsense by the waking mind that does not recognize their sig- niﬁcance. (14) Freud’s belief in the signiﬁcance of dreams, of course, was no more original than his belief that there is an unconscious side to the psyche. Again, it was the extent to which he developed a theory of how dreams work — and the extent to which that theory helped him, by analogy, to understand far more than just dreams — that made him unusual,WHAT IS PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM? 265 important, and inﬂuential beyond the perimeters of medical schools and psychiatrists’ ofﬁces. The psychoanalytic approach to literature not only rests on the the- ories of Freud; it may even be said to have begun with Freud, who was interested in writers, especially those who relied heavily on symbols. Such writers regularly cloak or mystify ideas in ﬁgures that make sense only when interpreted, much as the unconscious mind of a neurotic dis- guises secret thoughts in dream stories or bizarre actions that need to be interpreted by an analyst. Freud’s interest in literary artists led him to make some unfortunate generalizations about creativity; for ex- ample, in the twenty-third lecture in Introductory Lectures on Psycho- Analysis (1922), he deﬁned the artist as “one urged on by instinctive needs that are too clamorous” (314). But it also led him to write cre- ative literary criticism of his own, including an inﬂuential essay on “The Relation of a Poet to Daydreaming” (1908) and “The Uncanny” (1919), a provocative psychoanalytic reading of E. T. A. Hoffman’s supernatural tale “The Sandman.” Freud’s application of psychoanalytic theory to literature quickly caught on. In 1909, only a year after Freud had published “The Rela- tion of a Poet to Daydreaming,” the psychoanalyst Otto Rank pub- lished The Myth of the Birth of the Hero. In that work, Rank subscribes to the notion that the artist turns a powerful, secret wish into a literary fantasy, and he uses Freud’s notion about the “oedipal” complex to explain why the popular stories of so many heroes in literature are so similar. A year after Rank had published his psychoanalytic account of heroic texts, Ernest Iones, Freud’s student and eventual biographer, turned his attention to a tragic text: Shakespeare’s Hamlet. In an essay ﬁrst published in the American ]ournal of Psychology, Iones, like Rank, makes use of the oedipal concept: he suggests that Hamlet is a victim of strong feelings toward his mother, the queen. Between 1909 and 1949, numerous other critics decided that psy- chological and psychoanalytic theory could assist in the understanding of literature. I. A. Richards, Kenneth Burke, and Edmund Wilson were among the most inﬂuential to become interested in the new approach. Not all of the early critics were committed to the approach; neither were all of them Freudians. Some followed Alfred Adler, who believed that writers wrote out of inferiority complexes, and others applied the ideas of Carl Gustav Iung, who had broken with Freud over Freud’s emphasis on sex and who had developed a theory of the collective266 PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM unconscious. According to Iungian theory, a great work of literature is not a disguised expression of its author’s personal, repressed wishes; rather, it is a manifestation of desires once held by the whole human race but now repressed because of the advent of civilization. It is important to point out that among those who relied on Freud’s models were a number of critics who were poets and novelists as well. Conrad Aiken wrote a Freudian study of American literature, and poets such as Robert Graves and W. H. Auden applied Freudian insights when writing critical prose. William Faulkner, Henry Iames, Iames Ioyce, D. H. Lawrence, Marcel Proust, and Toni Morrison are only a few of the novelists who have either written criticism inﬂuenced by Freud or who have written novels that conceive of character, conﬂict, and creative writing itself in Freudian terms. The poet H. D. (Hilda Doolittle) was actually a patient of Freud’s and provided an account of her analysis in her book Tribute to Freud. By giving Freudian theory credibility among students of literature that only they could bestow, such writers helped to endow earlier psychoanalytic criticism with a largely Freudian orientation that has begun to be challenged only in the last two decades. The willingness, even eagerness, of writers to use Freudian models in producing literature and criticism of their own consummated a rela- tionship that, to Freud and other pioneering psychoanalytic theorists, had seemed fated from the beginning; after all, therapy involves the close analysis of language. René Wellek and Austin Warren included “psychological” criticism as one of the ﬁve “extrinsic” approaches to lit- erature described in their inﬂuential book Theory of Literature (1942). Psychological criticism, they suggest, typically attempts to do at least one of the following: provide a psychological study of an individual writer; explore the nature of the creative process; generalize about “types and laws present within works of literature”; or theorize about the psychological “effects of literature upon its readers” (81). Entire books on psychoanalytic criticism began to appear, such as Frederick I. Hoffman’s Freudianism and the Literary Mind (1945). Probably because of Freud’s characterization of the creative mind as “clamorous” if not ill, psychoanalytic criticism written before 1950 tended to psychoanalyze the individual author. Poems were read as fan- tasies that allowed authors to indulge repressed wishes, to protect themselves from deep-seated anxieties, or both. A perfect example of author analysis would be Marie Bonaparte’s 1933 study of Edgar Allan Poe. Bonaparte found Poe to be so ﬁxated on his mother that hisWHAT IS PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM? 267 repressed longing emerges in his stories in images such as the white spot on a black cat’s breast, said to represent mother’s milk. A later generation of psychoanalytic critics often paused to analyze the characters in novels and plays before proceeding to their authors. But not for long, since characters, both evil and good, tended to be seen by these critics as the author’s potential selves, or projections of various repressed aspects of his or her psyche. For instance, in A Psycho- analytic Study of the Double in Literature (1970), Robert Rogers begins with the view that human beings are double or multiple in nature. Using this assumption, along with the psychoanalytic concept of “dis- sociation” (best known by its result, the dual or multiple personality), Rogers concludes that writers reveal instinctual or repressed selves in their books, often without realizing that they have done so. In the view of critics attempting to arrive at more psychological insights into an author than biographical materials can provide, a work of literature is a fantasy or a dream — or at least so analogous to day- dream or dream that Freudian analysis can help explain the nature of the mind that produced it. The author’s purpose in writing is to gratify secretly some forbidden wish, in particular an infantile wish or desire that has been repressed into the unconscious mind. To discover what the wish is, the psychoanalytic critic employs many of the terms and procedures developed by Freud to analyze dreams. The literal surface of a work is sometimes spoken of as its “manifest content” and treated as a “manifest dream” or “dream story” would be treated by a Freudian analyst. Iust as the analyst tries to ﬁgure out the “dream thought” behind the dream story — that is, the latent or hid- den content of the manifest dream —so the psychoanalytic literary critic tries to expose the latent, underlying content of a work. Freud used the words condensation and displacement to explain two of the mental processes whereby the mind disguises its wishes and fears in dream stories. In condensation, several thoughts or persons may be condensed into a single manifestation or image in a dream story; in dis- placement, an anxiety, a wish, or a person may be displaced onto the image of another, with which or whom it is loosely connected through a string of associations that only an analyst can untangle. Psychoanalytic critics treat metaphors as if they were dream condensations; they treat metonyms — ﬁgures of speech based on extremely loose, arbitrary associations — as if they were dream displacements. Thus ﬁgurative lit- erary language in general is treated as something that evolves as the writer’s conscious mind resists what the unconscious tells it to picture268 PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM or describe. A symbol is, in Daniel Weiss’s words, “a meaningful con- cealment of truth as the truth promises to emerge as some frightening or forbidden idea” (20). In a 1970 article entitled “The ‘Unconscious’ of Literature,” Nor- man Holland, a literary critic trained in psychoanalysis, succinctly sums up the attitudes held by critics who would psychoanalyze authors, but without quite saying that it is the author that is being analyzed by the psychoanalytic critic. “When one looks at a poem psychoanalytically,” he writes, “one considers it as though it were a dream or as though some ideal patient [were speaking] from the couch in iambic pentame- ter.” One “looks for the general level or levels of fantasy associated with the language. By level I mean the familiar stages of childhood develop- ment — oral [when desires for nourishment and infantile sexual desires overlap], anal [when infants receive their primary pleasure from defeca- tion], urethral [when urinary functions are the locus of sexual plea- sure], phallic [when the penis or, in girls, some penis substitute is of primary interest], oedipal.” Holland continues by analyzing not Robert Frost but Frost’s poem “Mending Wall” as a speciﬁcally oral fantasy that is not unique to its author. “Mending Wall” is “about breaking down the wall which marks the separated or individuated self so as to return to a state of closeness to some Other”— including and perhaps essentially the nursing mother (“ ‘Unconscious’ ” 136, 139). While not denying the idea that the unconscious plays a role in cre- ativity, psychoanalytic critics such as Holland began to focus more on the ways in which authors create works that appeal to our repressed wishes and fantasies. Consequently, they shifted their focus away from the psyche of the author and toward the psychology of the reader and the text. Holland’s theories, which have concerned themselves more with the reader than with the text, have helped to establish another school of critical theory: reader-response criticism. Elizabeth Wright explains Holland’s brand of modern psychoanalytic criticism in this way: “What draws us as readers to a text is the secret expression of what we desire to hear, much as we protest we do not. The disguise must be good enough to fool the censor into thinking that the text is re- spectable, but bad enough to allow the unconscious to glimpse the unrespectable” (1 1 7). Holland is one of dozens of critics who have revised Freud signiﬁ- cantly in the process of revitalizing psychoanalytic criticism. Another such critic is R- D. Laing, whose controversial and often poetical writ- ings about personality, repression, masks, and the double or “schizoid”WHAT IS PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM? 269 self have (re)blurred the boundary between creative writing and psy- choanalytic discourse. Yet another is D. W. Winnicott, an “object rela- tions” theorist who has had a signiﬁcant impact on literary criticism. Critics inﬂuenced by Winnicott and his school have questioned the ten- dency to see reader/ text as an either/or construct; instead, they have seen reader and text (or audience and play) in terms of a relationship taking place in what Winnicott calls a “transitional” or “potential” space — space in which binary terms such as real and illusory, objective and subjective, have little or no meaning. Psychoanalytic theorists inﬂuenced by Winnicott see the transi- tional or potential reader/ text (or audience/play) space as being like the space entered into by psychoanalyst and patient. More important, they also see it as being similar to the space between mother and infant: a space characterized by trust in which categorizing terms such as knowing and feeling mix and merge and have little meaning apart from one another. VVhereas Freud saw the mother-son relationship in terms of the son and his repressed oedipal complex (and saw the analyst-patient relation- ship in terms of the patient and the repressed “truth” that the analyst could scientiﬁcally extract), object-relations analysts see both relation- ships as dyadic — that is, as being dynamic in both directions. Conse- quently, they don’t depersonalize analysis or their analyses. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that contemporary literary critics who apply object-relations theory to the texts they discuss don’t depersonalize critics or categorize their interpretations as “truthful,” at least not in any objective or scientiﬁc sense. In the view of such critics, interpreta- tions are made of language — itself a transitional object—and are themselves the mediating terms or transitional objects of a relationship. Like critics of the Winnicottian school, the French structuralist the- orist Iacques Lacan focused on language and language-related issues. He treated the unconscious as a language and, consequently, viewed the dream not as Freud did (that is, as a form and symptom of repres- sion) but rather as a form of discourse. Thus we may study dreams psy- choanalytically to learn about literature, even as we may study literature to learn more about the unconscious. In Lacan’s seminar on Poe’s “The Purloined Letter,” a pattern of repetition like that used by psy- choanalysts in their analyses is used to arrive at a reading of the story. According to Wright, “the new psychoanalytic structural approach to literature” employs “analogies from psychoanalysis . . . to explain the workings of the text as distinct from the workings of a particular author’s, character’s, or even reader’s mind” (125). __J_r--~ _.. __..____=__ P, ____ _27O PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM Lacan, however, did far more than extend Freud’s theory of dreams, literature, and the interpretation of both. More signiﬁcantly, he took Freud’s whole theory of psyche and gender and added to it a cru- cial third term — that of language. In the process, he both used and signiﬁcantly developed Freud’s ideas about the oedipal stage and complex. Lacan pointed out that the pre-oedipal stage, in which the child at ﬁrst does not even recognize its independence from its mother, is also a preverbal stage, one in which the child communicates without the medium of language, or — ifwe insist on calling the child’s communi- cations a language — in a language that can only be called literal. (“Coos,” certainly, cannot be said to be ﬁgurative or symbolic.) Then, while still in the pre-oedipal stage, the child enters the mirror stage. During the mirror period, the child comes to view itself and its mother, later other people as well, as independent selves. This is the stage in which the child is ﬁrst able to fear the aggressions of another, to desire what is recognizably beyond the self (initially the mother), and, ﬁnally, to want to compete with another for the same desired object. This is also the stage at which the child ﬁrst becomes able to feel sympa- thy with another being who is being hurt by a third, to cry when another cries. All of these developments, of course, involve projecting beyond the self and, by extension, constructing one’s own self (or “ego” or “I”) as others view one — that is, as another. Such constructions, according to Lacan, are just that: constructs, products, artifacts — ﬁc- tions of coherence that in fact hide what Lacan called the “absence” or “lack” of being. The mirror stage, which Lacan also referred to as the imaginary stage, is fairly quickly succeeded by the oedipal stage. As in Freud, this stage begins when the child, having come to view itself as self and the father and mother as separate selves, perceives gender and gender dif- ferences between its parents and between itself and one of its parents. For boys, gender awareness involves another, more powerful recogni- tion, for the recognition of the father’s phallus as the mark of his differ- ence from the mother involves, at the same time, the recognition that his older and more powerful father is also his rival. That, in turn, leads to the understanding that what once seemed wholly his and even in- distinguishable from himself is in fact someone else’s: something prop- erly desired only at a distance and in the form of socially acceptable substitutes. The fact that the oedipal stage roughly coincides with the entry of the child into language is extremely important for Lacan. For the lin-WHAT IS PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM? 271 guistic order is essentially a ﬁgurative or “Symbolic” order; words are not the things they stand for but are, rather stand-ins or substitutes for those things. Hence boys, who in the most critical period of their devel- opment have had to submit to what Lacan called the “Law of the Father”— a law that prohibits direct desire for and communicative inti- macy with what has been the boy’s whole world — enter more easily into the realm of language and the Symbolic order than do girls, who have never really had to renounce that which once seemed continuous with the self: the mother. The gap that has been opened up for boys, which includes the gap between signs and what they substitute — the gap marked by the phallus and encoded with the boy’s sense of his maleness — has not opened up for girls, or has not opened up in the same way, to the same degree. For Lacan, the father need not be present to trigger the oedipal stage; nor does his phallus have to be seen to catalyze the boy’s (easier) transition into the Symbolic order. Rather, Lacan argued, a child’s recognition of its gender is intricately tied up with a growing recogni- tion of the system of names and naming, part of the larger system of substitutions we call language. A child has little doubt about who its mother is, but who is its father, and how would one know? The father’s claim rests on the mother’s word that he is in fact the father; the father’s relationship to the child is thus established through language and a sys- tem of marriage and kinship — names — that in turn is basic to rules of everything from property to law. The name of the father (nom du pere, which in French sounds like non du pere) involves, in a sense, nothing of the father — nothing, that is, except his word or name. Lacan’s development of Freud has had several important results. First, his sexist-seeming association of maleness with the Symbolic order, together with his claim that women cannot therefore enter easily into the order, has prompted feminists not to reject his theory out of hand but, rather, to look more closely at the relation between language and gender, language and women’s inequality. Some feminists have gone so far as to suggest that the social and political relationships between male and female will not be fundamentally altered until lan- guage itself has been radically changed. (That change might begin dialectically, with the development of some kind of “feminine lan- guage” grounded in the presymbolic, literal-to-imaginary communica- tion between mother and child.) Second, Lacan’s theory has proved of interest to deconstructors and other poststructuralists, in part because it holds that the ego (which in Freud’s view is as necessary as it is natural) is a product or construct. ’,.‘l ‘_l._.’__.n. _¢in-—-~ .1. ..._-_,-_; - __ 1272 PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM The ego-artifact, produced during the mirror stage, seems at once uni- ﬁed, consistent, and organized around a determinate center. But the uniﬁed self, or ego, is a ﬁction, according to Lacan. The yoking together of fragments and destructively dissimilar elements takes its psychic toll, and it is the job of the Lacanian psychoanalyst to “decon- struct,” as it were, the ego, to show its continuities to be contradictions as well. In the essay that follows, David Collings sees Frankenstein as a novel consisting of two realms: one proper and public and dominated by language and law (that of Alphonse Frankenstein and the De Lacey family), the other private — even secret — and incommunicable (that of Victor Frankenstein and his monster). These two worlds correspond, in Collings’s view, to Lacan’s Symbolic and Imaginary orders. In the ﬁrst world, trials are held and language reigns supreme; the second exists outside society and language, containing only Victor and his double. Collings, using Lacan’s concepts, suggests that Victor’s passage from the Imaginary into the Symbolic realms has been incomplete. He points out that we learn near the beginning of the novel that Victor’s studies have included “neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states” (p. 45 in this vol- ume) — all of which, as Collings points out, are associated with what Lacan calls the Symbolic order. If Victor had fully and entirely emerged from the Imaginary order and entered the Symbolic, Collings goes on to say, he would have resolved what both Freud and Lacan would call his oedipal conﬂict by marrying a substitute for his mother. Instead, Victor rejects Elizabeth (whose nature and story nearly double that of his mother) and chooses to look into “the physical secrets of the world” — nature in “her hiding places” (p. 45, 53). Thus, in Collings’s words, Victor continues “spurn- ing the social realm in favor of the bodily mother, whom he attempts to recover by creating the monster” (p. 281). Pointing out that the death of Victor’s mother and the later creation of the monster are closely intertwined within the text, Collings goes on to show the numerous ways in which the monster represents not a mother substitute but the body of the mother lost on entrance into the Symbolic order. Of course, Victor has partially emerged from the pre-oedipal mirror stage and entered into some of the terms of the patriarchal or Symbolic order. If he hadn’t, he couldn’t speak to teachers or function at a uni-WHAT IS PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM? 273 versity. As a result of the fact that he has partially emerged into the Symbolic order, his attempt to re-create the body of the lost mother is botched — as botched as his passage out of the Imaginary order has been rough and incomplete. His creation ends up resembling his own mirror image more than it does his maternal object. But what a terrifying mental image it is! Lacan maintained that the infant is “jubilant” upon seeing its own reﬂected image as such. This is because the image is, in Collings’s words, a “pleasingly coher- ent” picture from which “the child constructs the ﬁction of a uniﬁed ego,” thereby “warding off the possibility” that the self — and even the body — “may be an assortment of disjointed and unrelated parts.” Vict0r’s monstrous mirror image, instead of “warding off ” that prospect, explicitly represents “the body as a random assemblage” and “reveal[s] . . . that the uniﬁed self is a ﬁction” (p. 285). Collings further explains the horror Victor feels upon looking onto the creature, and into its eyes, by citing Mladen Dolar’s development of Lacanian theory. Dolar argues that, at the mirror stage, we necessarily see ourselves from the outside, as others see us, in the process losing “‘that uniqueness that one could enjoy in one’s seIf-being’”: what Lacan referred to as “the object a,” that which we will from then on desire but never regain (p. 285). When Victor sees the monster, accord- ing to Collings, he “does not encounter himself as another person” but, rather, “that element of the self ” that human beings irretrievably lose when they ﬁrst recognize themselves in a mirror (p. 286). In the moment he regains that object of desire, Victor also “lose[s] the lack that makes him human.” Thus, according to Collings’s Lacanian reading, “When the mon- ster awakes, he embodies both the maternal Thing and the object a, both the lost maternal body and the missing element of Victor himself. He is doubly impossible, representing two taboos at once” (p. 287), and in creating him Shelley envisioned a form of desire unidentiﬁed by either Freud or Lacan. For beyond the longing for coherent being, beyond the desire to defy the taboo against oedipal incest, she has revealed “the wish to recover what one was before one became human: to become a monster” (p. 287). Shelley, Collings argues, subsequently attempts to “humanize” the position of the monster, to suggest that no monstrousness is innate but is, rather, only grotesque in the eyes of some society and its ideology. She carries out her critique of cultural norms regarding the desirable and the undesirable — the good, the bad, and the ugly — by allowing274 PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM that which is “doubly impossible, . . . two taboos at once,” to speak and express its own desire: speciﬁcally, to enter society, have a bride and a family, and, in short, enter the Symbolic order! It is at this point that Collings’s essay begins fully to justify its title, for what follows is a discussion that enlarges its focus on individual development through the Imaginary, mirror, oedipal, and Symbolic stages to include certain collective social fantasies alluded to in the essay’s ﬁrst paragraph. According to these fantasies, which are the prod- ucts of ideology, there is “someone,” i.e., some minority group, who gets some kind of pleasure — jouissance— from monstrous behavior of a type “civilized” people don’t desire. What people subject to the ideology may not be able to see — but that the psychoanalytic approach to texts and their culture exposes —is the horribly ﬁctive nature of these myths of difference. It also suggests something even more basic, namely, that just as the Victor Frankensteins of the world may want to be monsters, those unfairly tagged as monsters only want to be people.

It might seem even more strange to make this argument using the resources of psychoanalytic theory. Yet this is one of the great virtues of such theory in the wake of Iacques Lacan: it can at once decipher the signiﬁcance of the uncanny and clarify the relation between the construction of desire and of modern society, primarily because it conceives of society as the product of a collective fantasy, as a psychoanalytic construct in its own right. Lacan and Shelley both sug- gest that society orients itself toward the fantasy of an impossible fulﬁll- ment which, if ever realized, would be the source of great dread — and that such a fantasy supports ideology by allowing us to blame the divided condition of the psyche or of society on others. Conﬂating utopias and monsters, Shelley anticipates Lacanian theory, urging us to recognize the limits of the emancipatory dream, accept the conﬂicts of modern society, and thereby undo the very logic that enables prejudice and exclusion. The world of Frankenstein is deeply divided. On the one hand, there is a social order rooted in kinship, marriage, and legality, related to what Lacan calls the Symbolic order, exempliﬁed by the dutiful father and judge Alphonse Frankenstein, the families of the Franken- steins and the De Laceys, the possibility of Victor’s marriage with Eliza- beth, the responsible science of M. Krempe, and the operation of law in the trial of Iustine and the imprisonment of Victor. On the other hand, there is the domain of rivalry between Victor and his creature, resem- bling Lacan’s Imaginary order, exempliﬁed by the curious solitude of each, the fact that neither can belong to a family, their endless fascina- tion with each other, and their utter incapacity to communicate their situation to anyone else (except of course Robert Walton, the novel’s narrator). Victor’s obsession with his double compels him to resist or attack his father, friend, and potential wife whenever they threaten that self. His solitude is so profound that his obsession with and fear of theDAVID COLLINGS 281 monster would amount to madness were it not that another person, Walton, encounters the monster in the novel’s ﬁnal pages. The early pages of Victor’s story emphasize the distinctively oedipal quality of his solitude. As a young scholar, Victor studies “neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states,” all subjects associated with the Symbolic order, but rather “the physical secrets of the world” (p. 45 in this volume). More- over, within the physical sciences, he pursues the outmoded and semi- magical arts of Agrippa, Paracelsus, and Albertus Magnus in deﬁance of his father’s prohibition, as if replaying the oedipus complex in his intel- lectual pursuits. A similar oedipal drama is performed after Victor arrives at the university. The ugly, forbidding M. Krempe scoffs at the alchemists (p. 51), but Waldman indirectly praises them and describes modern chemistry in sexually resonant terms: the modern masters “penetrate into the recesses of nature, and show how she works in her hiding places” (p. 53). While Victor’s oedipal yearnings are familiar, they do not lead him toward the normative resolution, in which the son relinquishes his mother and desires a person who resembles her. Margaret Homans argues that in effect the son gives up the physical mother and desires a ﬁgurative representation of her, a substitute for her in the realm of lan- guage or social relations. She proposes that Victor’s development is typical because he attempts to re-create his mother in his scientiﬁc, intellectual project and thus in the realm of language (9-10, 101-2, 107). But the novel presents Elizabeth, not the monster, as the ideal ﬁgure for the mother; her personality and biography almost duplicate Caroline Frankenstein’s, as if she is in fact the perfect person to com- plete the oedipal drama. Victor resists the seemingly inevitable marriage to Elizabeth, leaves home, and chooses another, forbidden erotic object: the mystery of how nature works in “her” hiding places — the mystery of the feminine body. That is, he chooses to take exactly the opposite of the typical path, spurning the social realm in favor of the bodily mother, whom he attempts to recover by creating the monster. This relation between the mother and monster is made clear in the episodes surrounding Victor’s going to the university. The break from the family represents Victor’s entrance into the public world and his separation from his mother. Thus her death immediately before his leaving is highly appropriate; it represents Victor’s separation from her and the loss consequent on accepting his place in the Symbolic order. Despite himself, Victor must leave her behind, tell himself not to grieve over his loss (p. 50), and go on to begin a career. Yet, as we have seen,282 PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM once he gets to the university he refuses to participate in authorized scientiﬁc activities and falls prey to his longing for forbidden knowl- edge. He identiﬁes with his mother, recovering her body in his own as he attempts to become pregnant himself, to labor in childbirth, and to watch the child awaken, gesture, and attempt to speak (see pp. 57-62). He also attempts to re-create her by reassembling her dead body, as it were, from “bones from charnel-houses” (p. 58), animating it, and looking up at it (as would a child at its mother) as he lies in bed (p. 58). In the midst of these depictions of the monster’s infantile and maternal attributes comes Victor’s dream: I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her; but as I imprinted the ﬁrst kiss on her lips, they became livid vw-th the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the graveworms crawling in the folds ofthe ﬂannel. (p. 61) In a reversal of the normative shift, here the potential lover (Elizabeth) transforms back into the dead mother she is supposed to replace. For Victor, feminine sexuality can never be separated from the mother he has lost; as soon as he imagines touching Elizabeth, the ﬁgurative sub- stitute for her turns back into her physical form, and then — impos- sibly — into the all-too-literal and present form of the monster itself, whom Victor, immediately after this passage, sees upon awakening from his dream. In effect, all women are for him the dead mother, the all-too-physical person he left when he went to the university. Further- more, because he entered the university on the condition that he leave behind the dead mother, she necessarily appears as a monstrously phys- ical intruder in the world of masculine learning. It would be impossible for Elizabeth to walk in Ingolstadt without seeming to be a visitor from the dead, nor could the product of Victor’s rapturous discovery of “the cause of generation and life” (pp. 56-57) arise without being rec- ognized as a walking corpse. Clearly, the turn from erotic ideal to grotesque body horriﬁes Victor, and in this respect he is a responsible citizen of the Symbolic realm, longing for Elizabeth rather than the mother. Yet this horror is so strong, and this dream so necessary, because of his unspeakable desire for the secret of the dead mother’s body, for that element of her that has no substitute.DAVID COLLINGS 283 What Lacan would call the Imaginary nature of his relation to the monster is further reinforced in the visual imagery of the passage: when Victor awakens, he sees, “by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters,” the monster, who ﬁxes on Victor “his eyes, if eyes they may be called” (p. 61). A peculiar and intense sight dominates in this passage: a haunting light cast on a ghastly ﬁgure, framed by the window, who gazes back with inhuman eyes. This seems to be the return of a deeply repressed mirror stage in which the monster is Victor’s own reﬂection. As if to emphasize the prelinguistic nature of this moment, Shelley goes on to write: “His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrin- kled his cheeks” (p. 61). The mirrorlike quality of Victor’s encounter with the monster is clearer elsewhere in the novel where the nearly hal- lucinatory image recurs: at the destruction of the female monster (“I trembled, and my heart failed within me; when, on looking up, I saw, by the light of the moon, the dxmon at the casement” [p. 145]) and, most clearly, at the death of Elizabeth (p. 168). In all these passages, the window represents the mirror, a framed surface on which always appears the face of the demonic double. All this is complicated by Shelley’s account of the conception of the novel: When I placed my head on my pillow, I did not sleep, nor could I be said to think. My imagination, unbidden, possessed and guided me, gifting the successive images that arose in my mind with a vividness far beyond the usual bounds of reverie. I saw — with shut eyes, but acute mental vision, — I saw the pale student of unhal- lowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. . . . I opened [my eyes] in terror. . . . I wished to exchange the ghastly image of my fancy for the realities around. I see them still; the very room, the dark parquet, the closed shutters, with the moon- light struggling through, and the sense I had that the glassy lake and white high Alps were beyond. (Introduction p. 24) Shelley’s emphasis on the haunting “vividness” of this “acute mental vision” locates it outside of ordinary, waking sight — in the Imaginary realm. Her reference to “the realities around” leads her to further men- tal images, “sense[d]” through the closed shutters, of the lake and Alps, or perhaps of the Alps reﬂected in the lake, another kind of mirror, and the intense seeing of the original vision (emphasized through the repe- tition of the words “I saw”) is repeated late in the passage (“I see them still”).284 PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM For both Shelley and her character Victor Frankenstein, creation takes place neither in the Symbolic moment of uttering words (as in the Biblical Genesis) nor even of writing them but in the moment of an astonishing visual literalization when what they “see” comes to life. Anne Mellor has quite justiﬁably discussed Victor’s creation of the monster as a masculine attempt to circumvent the maternal, to usurp and destroy the life-giving power of feminine sexuality (220-32). But the strong parallels of the two creation scenes suggest instead that Vic- tor circumvents normative sexuality with a sexuality of the Imaginary in which the child can re-create the dead mother in a prelinguistic, visual mode. It is important that this visual imagery is most intense in moments both of creating (the novel, the monster) and of killing (the female monster, Elizabeth): by tying together these apparently opposite motifs, this imagery points to the way the novel operates according to the logic of the Imaginary, rather than the more familiar and normative Symbolic order. The female monster and Elizabeth represent not sim- ply feminine sexuality but its function within the world of the Symbolic, that is, of kinship and ﬁliation: Elizabeth as a married sexual partner and the female monster as a potential partner in creating a new society in South America — a new “chain of existence” (p. 131) that, as Peter Brooks points out, would be a new “systematic network of relation” akin to the Symbolic order (593). If we apply this reading to Mary Shelley as author, it suggests that literary creation is for her a form of matricide, of killing the kind of mother that is subordinated to a father or husband. Perhaps it is even a way to kill herself as such a mother. Bar- bara Iohnson argues this point, emphasizing the subtle link between the italics in the passages on the creating of the book and the killing of Elizabeth (Iohnson 8-9). In both cases, the italics culminate in a moment of a creation or murder rendered with a familiar kind of imag- istic intensity. On some level, the novel hints that creation through hal- lucinatory power, through the literal realization of a mental image, threatens to destroy sexual reproduction itself. But if the category of the Imaginary goes far to explaining these unusually constructed scenes, it cannot by itself explain what is so terri- fying in the monster. After all, one can see one’s face in a mirror with- out going into shock. While the monster clearly occupies a place in the Imaginary realm, he does so in an unusual way, one that Lacanian the- ory also helps explain. Lacan argues that the infant is “jubilant” on see- ing the reﬂected image precisely because that image, so pleasingly coherent, gives the child the illusion that the body itself is also coher-DAVID COLLINGS 285 ent. From this image the child constructs the ﬁction of a uniﬁed ego, warding off the possibility that one is not in fact one, that the body may be an assortment of disjointed and unrelated parts. To some extent, then, the child identiﬁes with the mirror-image to defend against the possibility of a fragmented body-image (Ecrits 1-5). When Victor sees the monster in the mirrorlike scenes throughout the novel, in effect he sees what the mirror-image is supposed to hide from him: the image of the body as a random assemblage. These scenes travesty the normative mirror-scene, undermine the ego, and reveal what neither Victor nor we wish to know: that the uniﬁed self is a ﬁction. Only now is it clear that by attempting to reconstruct the maternal body excluded by the Symbolic order, Victor produced a body that threatens the Imaginary order as well. What precedes language must in some way also precede the ego itself. But this analysis still does not fully explain Victor’s response to the creature. One would expect Victor to be familiar with the idea of the assembled body, since he gathered the parts of dead bodies himself. In fact, when he contemplates the creature just before it comes to life, he approves of his work and ﬁnds it beautiful. But once the creature opens its eyes, he cannot bear the sight. In this haunting version of the mirror- scene, everything works as if Victor looks in the mirror and sees the image begin to have a liﬁr of its own, moving in ways that do not reﬂect his gestures, and (worst of all) looking back with its own “dull yellow” eyes, “if eyes they may be called” (p. 61). Simply imagining such a scene happening to us can give us the creeps as well. But why? Mladen Dolar explains that when one seizes upon the ﬁction of a uniﬁed self in the mirror-stage by identifying with something outside the self, one loses “that uniqueness that one could enjoy in one’s self-being,” the element that Lacan calls the object a. To become a subject, one must lose an element of the subject forever: this loss enables one to care about the world of objects, to make demands on the world, and to desire (Dolar 13; cf. Lacan, Ecrits 5-6). Instead of merely existing as a unique being, for example, the child begins to pay attention to the mirror and to replicate the activities of other children (Lacan, Ecrits 18-19). Lacan argues that this loss structures desire, which will always seek what it is lacking: the object a. And this loss also marks the moment of the foreclosure of the Real, that notoriously difﬁ- cult Lacanian category, that largely mythical condition without lack or representation that accordingly appears as a hole or gap from the per- spective of the Symbolic or Imaginary orders (see Zizek, Sublime 170). Thus ordinarily when we look in the mirror, the image reﬂects us but286 PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM itself lacks the extra element that would make it a person, too. Oddly, then, we can only recognize ourselves in an image that in fact fails to depict us: we become human when something essential is subtracted from us. What shocks Victor is simply that the image comes to life, as if this essential thing has been added back. “The double,” writes Dolar, “is the same as me plus the object a, that invisible part of being added to my image” (13). Victor does not encounter himself as another per- son: that would be startling enough, to be sure, but not as strange as actually seeing as an image that element of the self that one loses when one recognizes one’s reﬂection in the mirror. Suddenly he sees what it would be like to be an image and be complete, too: to appear in the world and lack nothing. We might think that Victor would be ecstatic at gaining such access to wholeness. But in such a moment he would lose the lack that makes him human, the form of desire that gives him subjectivity, the invisible thing that made the visible world signiﬁcant to him. As Dolar writes, he has now gained “something too much” by losing “the loss that made it possible to deal with a coherent reality” (13). In short, he has encoun- tered the Lacanian Real in such a way that his sense of ordinary reality is in danger of disappearing entirely. Shelley makes this uncanny moment possible when she takes advan- tage of the conventions of supernatural ﬁction and allows the impos- sible to take place. By imagining such a counterfactual scenario, she indirectly reveals much about the nature of desire. Dolar argues that to some extent Victor represents the Enlightenment project insofar as he seeks to confer an unprecedented blessing on humanity. But the realiza- tion of his project is far worse than what it sought to correct (17-18). There is something frustrating about imagining a utopia and not watching it come to pass, but it is even worse if the seemingly impos- sible ideal is actually realized. The advent of a genuine utopia would in fact destroy the need for political activity or the desire for a different future. It would obliterate the lack that drives historical change. Simi- larly, when Victor succeeds in realizing his wish to revive what he has lost, he need no longer sustain a separate image, name, or identity. The encounter with the Real at least potentially shatters him as a human subject. The novel thus suggests that the Symbolic, the Imaginary, and the sense of ordinary reality itself depend on the primordial loss of the maternal body; to revive it is to threaten the order of the world. If, as I have argued, the monster is the resurrected maternal body, how can he also capture the lost part of the self ? What is the relation between the two readings I have given of the creation scene so far?DAVID COLLINGS 287 Lacan argues that the primordial lost object is the mother; she is the Thing whose absence structures desire and the unconscious, just as the prohibition of incest with her anchors all further elaborations of the law (Ethics 67-68). But to capture the signiﬁcance of Shelley’s monster, one must add a twist or two to Lacan’s analysis. When the monster awakes, he embodies both the maternal Thing and the object a, both the lost maternal body and the missing element of Victor himself. He is doubly impossible, representing two taboos at once. On some level, Shelley’s point does not seem so difﬁcult: after all, it makes sense that in the mirror-stage, when one loses access to the prior, disorganized but undivided bodily mode, one simultaneously loses the earliest version of the maternal body as well. But the creation scene implicitly suggests that the element we seek in desire — the object a — is to be found in a body so formless that it has no gender and does not even constitute a person. By writing a novel not only about the double (all in all, a rather familiar topic in the Gothic) but about something that travesties the coherent body image as well, Shelley uncovers an element of desire Lacan never quite theorized: the longing to rejoin and/ or to be some- thing that a person who has been through the mirror stage can imagine only as a monster. Behind the fascination with the double, behind the longing to violate the incest taboo, lies the wish to recover what one was before one became human: to become a monster. One reason that this reading seems a little implausible is that the novel suggests it only on occasion — for example, through Victor’s dream — but usually emphasizes other aspects of the creature. The fact that the monster is a “man” and, later in the novel, can confront Victor “man” to man, seeking a female mate and demanding a form of jus- tice, places the creature on a somewhat more familiar footing, even if still uncanny. Perhaps the idea that the creature is his masculine double helps Victor ward off the even more frightening wish that he be the dead mother. The ultimate forbidden object, it seems, is the maternal Thing. The novel’s depiction of Victor’s project is already provocative enough. But even more radically, it allows the supposed impossible object to speak and to desire. With this simple step, Mary Shelley places limits upon Victor’s entire way of relating to his creature, suggesting that the creature, existing with a human consciousness of its own, is someone other than a projection of Victor’s psyche. In effect, she tries to humanize the position of the impossible object, to imagine what it would be like for a monster to sustain personhood when everybody288 PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM around him treats him as an utterly alien being. In this way, she shows that the monster “is not ‘in itself” monstrous, [for] there is no inherent monstrousness,” only whatever fails to ﬁt into “the facile categorizing of the social and cultural order” (Musselwhite 59). If we follow Shelley and try to look at the world through the creature’s eyes, human desire — whether that of Victor or of the novel’s other characters — appears to be steeped in illusions. In this way Shelley carries out a wholesale critique of the structure of desire and challenges her readers to recognize its ideological dimension. The creature’s bizarre form of embodiment is clear in his own mirror-scene. Having “admired the perfect forms of [his] cottagers,” he looks into a pool and is terriﬁed, “unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reﬂected in the mirror” (p. 104). In a gesture that should remind us of Victor’s response to him, he cannot identify the image with himself, for evidently he sees there a form of bodily in- coherence not compatible with the “I,” the ego he wants to protect. Strangely enough, the creature’s image is alien even to him — as if his very body literalizes a principle threatening to every possible form of subjectivity. This scene establishes that those who respond to his appearance with hostility are not deranged; the creature himself ﬁnds his appearance unbearable. Of course, the monster does not accept his status, for he longs to enter the social world, belong to a family, converse, and have a sexual partner. He wishes, in short, to enter the Symbolic order. If Victor cre- ates the monster in order to revolt against the Symbolic, the monster protests against being excluded from it. He understands his condition well: early in their conversation high in the Alps when Victor cries out, “ ‘Begone! relieve me from the sight of your detested form,’ ” the mon- ster replies by placing his hands over Victor’s eyes (p. 94), mocking his ﬁxation on the sight of his form (Brooks 592). In the narrative that fol- lows, the monster attempts to replace his appearance with his words (Brooks 593), just as he attempts to cut across the dual relation be- tween Victor and himself with his demands for a female partner who could offer him a social and sexual relation. Despite his best efforts, however, the creature remains caught on the margins of the Symbolic. The story the monster tells Victor, primar- ily about his acquisition of language from the De Lacey family, drama- tizes this marginal position. Crouching there in the lean-to next to the family’s cottage, he can listen to everything that people say but cannot participate in their conversations. He can learn the words, but he can- not share in the social exchange of words and must remain an invisibleDAVID COLLINGS Z89 presence unknown to the family. It is no surprise that the monster learns along with Saﬁe, as if he, too, is both foreign and a woman. Crit- ics have remarked that he is thus placed in the position of the woman who, like Eve or Mary Shelley, eavesdrops on the conversations of men (see, for example, Gilbert and Gubar 238). As a result, his condition is similar to that of woman in Lacanian theory. As Iacqueline Rose puts it, “woman is excluded by the nature of words” but not “ from the nature of words” (49), on the one hand being given a sexual and gender iden- tity through language and on the other being excluded from language as it is based in the father’s name. Oddly enough, the creature becomes deﬁned by language without receiving the name-of-the-father, in effect dramatizing the condition of women in most Western cultures, whose names come from men and who thus remain in one sense nameless. Shelley dramatizes these problematic qualities of language when she renders the elder De Lacey blind. This father seems to have forgotten about the Imaginary and to live entirely within the world of words. Hardly moving from his place in the cottage, he only speaks, listens to someone read, and teaches people words: like Saﬁe and the monster, he too is a consummate listener, but because he is already the master of the language and need not see the objects to which words refer. In effect, he represents the blindness of language, its apparent indifference to the body and to sight. This old man has almost ceased to be an actual father and become a parodic version of the name-of-the-father, the father as nothing but names. Although the father’s blindness might indicate that he is so alien- ated from the visual world he need no longer see it, the monster inter- prets that blindness differently. Perhaps the old man, unable to see the monster, will accept him simply because he speaks. Blindness to the Imaginary may allow some tolerance for a body that travesties it. But in the crucial moment of the monster’s attempt to be accepted, Felix rushes in and violently ejects the monster from the cottage, and in the following days the entire family ﬂees the scene. The monster’s failure demonstrates that language is not indifferent but hostile to the mon- strous body, as if Victor’s cry to the monster (“Begonel”) merely made explicit the exclusionary principle that allows people to exchange words with each other in the ﬁrst place. So Saﬁe and the monster are ultimately quite different. She is ac- cepted into the cottage, after all, while he must remain outside. She has the name “Saﬁe,” while he has none. She can speak the language to others, while the creature discovers that he cannot do so safely. She has a story to tell that depicts the wrongs of woman, as if to echo one290 PSYCH OANALYTIC CRITICISM of the feminist ﬁctions written by Mary Shelley’s mother, Mary Woll- stonecraft. But the monster is denied even this form of protest; only an unspeakable secret can explain him. If Saﬁe represents woman as she is accepted into language and the family, the monster embodies woman as she is excluded from the world of images and words. He is even more foreign than she, representing what will always remain nameless and threatening in her. The monster’s condition is made clear again when he describes his experience as a reader. Recognizing that he is “similar, yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom” he reads in Goethe, Plutarch, or Milton (p. 115), he ﬁnds himself in an oblique relation to language. If we regard books as language preserved in print, then we can understand why the monster cannot ﬁnd anyone like him- self in them. Books exclude the bodies of the dead and preserve only their words, whereas the monster is pieced together solely out of frag- ments of corpses. The monster embodies precisely what books cannot preserve. The stories that books tell also have a way of replacing the body with words. Milton’s Paradise Lost, the myth of origins that the mon- ster reads, attributes origins not to physical nature but to the disem- bodied Word of God at the creation. Milton’s God is somewhat like a divine version of the Lacanian father, who lacks any direct physical link with the child and thus establishes his paternal authority through words, claiming that the child belongs to him. Indeed, that God goes even further, dispensing with nature or any other physical force and cre- ating the world out of his own Word, as if no mother of the world were necessary. Milton, following Biblical tradition, substitutes the father’s words for the mother’s body as origin so radically that the latter almost disappears. The story that the monster ﬁnds in Victor’s papers is very different: it tells of a bodily, maternal origin, as if the monster were pro- duced out of the mother’s body without her ever entering into sexual relations, as if she could create life without the participation of a father and without reference to the order of ﬁliation or gender. Here we ﬁnd the opposite of Milton’s myth of paternal origin: a celibate, solitary, and material creation. Thus the monster ﬁnds his origins in a kind of anti- Symbolic story, indeed an anti-story, which confusedly tells how bodies come from bodies without the need for a sexual relation, how “birth” takes place without the need for parents, in effect how the monster has no familial position worthy of the name. With such an anti-story in his pocket, the monster must remain nameless, for a name comes with aDAVID COLLINGS 291 story that tells how one originates in social and sexual relations, in kin- ship, and thus in language. If, as I have argued, the creature’s image is intolerable to him, if no person is willing to respond to him sympathetically, and if he is utterly caught within an alien order of being, how does he manage to sustain any kind of relation to the world? He does so only by demanding that he be given access to ordinary human experience, asking Victor to make him a partner with whom he could enter into social and sexual rela- tions. It turns out that the creature is like the rest of us: he lacks what he wants. Of course, his situation is unique, for what he wants is an approximation of the relations we usually take for granted. Yet that he is divided from his object suggests that he is no monster but simply a desiring subject; he is not the maternal Thing at all, for his bodily inco- herence gives him access to no special mode of being but only blocks his access to satisfaction. It appears that no person, not even one who supposedly represents the object of desire, ever truly has access to a mythical condition of fulﬁllment. If Victor wants to be a monster, the monster just wants to be another person. In a deeply ironic gesture, Shelley suggests (as does Lacan) that the category of the Real is ulti- mately empty, even if it persists as a dimension of our experience; that the maternal Thing does not exist, even if its prohibition continues to anchor the structure of law; and that we never possessed the lost object in the ﬁrst place, even if we continue to seek it (cf. Lacan, Ethics 118). As Zizek puts it, the paradox is that “this Thing is retroactively pro- duced by the very process of symbolization, i.e., that it emerges in the very gesture of its loss” (Tarrying 37). Because of this impasse, the creature establishes his relation to the world almost entirely by threatening Victor in more and more aggres- sive ways, eventually killing nearly every member of Victor’s circle — most tellingly, the virtuous Elizabeth on her wedding night. The crea- ture takes these actions as his only recourse in the long negotiation with Victor over his demand for a spouse. The fact that the monster limits his aggression to those whom Victor loves, all of whom happen to be exemplary in their sexual purity, allows many readers to construct almost allegorical readings of the book. For example, critics have argued that the monster represents the sexuality of Victor himself, which, in his hysterical condition, he wishes to repudiate (Hobbs), the sexuality that this sentimental family — and Shelley herself — represses (Hall), or the “fatal materiality of all life” and the stain of “impure birth” that, according to Shelley, “a civilized order” and especially this Pf -7-+¢'-'“-4 -*1---—~" e; -- .-292 PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM family “must keep at bay” (Youngquist 348-49). Such readings in effect suggest that the monster is a ﬁgure for what Lacan calls jouissance, a form of enjoyment so extravagant that society sustains the moral law out of recoil against it (Ethics 179-90). Of course, Shelley provides many details that support such read- ings. But one must proceed with caution here. To read the monster as if he is the sexuality of Victor or of his family is to forget that in this novel he is also a person separate from them in character and motivation. By his own account in his ﬁnal speech to Walton, these murders are any- thing but pleasurable. He is thus a ﬁgure of monstrous enjoyment only in the eyes of others, just as he is the maternal Thing not to himself but others. To them, the fact that his appearance threatens their sense of selfhood must mean his form of satisfaction is equally inhuman. If he is physically intolerable, he must be ethically intolerable as well. It is no surprise, then, to realize that for Lacan the illusory nature of these pro- jections is the same: he argues that nobody actually experiences jouis- sance per se, for it is as impossible to gain access to it as to the Real or to the maternal Thing (Ethics 203). It is a mythic experience, one we imagine that someone else (usually of another class, race, gender, or sex- ual orientation) might experience but that civilized people avoid (or, in another version, a bliss of which they have been deprived). It seems likely that Shelley makes these readings plausible precisely so that she can discredit the myth of jouissance in the same way that she undoes the myth of the maternal Thing: her goal, it seems, is to destroy the belief — whether Victor’s or ours — that some form of bodily, sexual, or emotional plenitude exists elsewhere, even while she shows that this myth underlies the very logic of desire. As the creature destroys more and more of the people in Victor’s circle and isolates his creator further, the two of them gradually move into the mode of direct rivalry. Because each sees the other as blocking his desire, each becomes ever more obsessed with wounding the other. The complexity of their relation now takes on the simplicity of the Imaginary: the monster is fated to deﬁne himself in relation to Victor, and vice versa, each becoming the other’s double, the mirror-self that haunts his every step. In the eyes of the law, they are indistinguishable: witnesses in Ireland mistake the dark ﬁgure in the boat for Victor (p. 152), and later when Victor tries to gain the law’s help in tracking down the monster, the judge assumes he is mad (p. 171). Caught in this relation to the double, each sees the other as his rival self, attacking the other and getting revenge in an endless spiral of violence, each revealing in this way what Lacan identiﬁes as the aggressive, paranoidDAVID COLLINGS 293 structure of the ego. Rivalry becomes a directly destructive force, reducing everything to the opposition between the Imaginary pair — an opposition that is never resolved by the intervention of a Symbolic law but that expires at last only with their deaths. As if to emphasize the impasses of the Imaginary, Shelley allows this Imaginary mode to expand beyond Victor and the monster and threaten to organize the structure of her entire novel, whose series of identiﬁcations and projections ultimately includes the reader. The crea- ture’s anti-Symbolic tale becomes one in which one narrator identiﬁes with another, who introduces yet a third, in a regress of tale within tale, mirror within mirror. I have no space to repeat here what critics have already discussed: the many resemblances between the narrators Mary Shelley and Margaret Saville (the woman who receives Walton’s letters and whose initials are also M. S.), Mary Shelley and Walton, Wal- ton and Victor, Victor and the monster, the monster and Saﬁe, and Saﬁe and Mary Shelley (see, among others, Brooks 603 and Rubenstein 168-72). Nor can I review the ways in which characters in the novel are orphaned and motherless (Gilbert and Gubar 227-28), with the result that they tend to create an identity through ﬁnding doubles of them- selves in other orphans. I can only point to the psychoanalytic coher- ence of this duplication of narratives, which, like the monster’s tale to Victor in the heart of the novel, follow from and return to Victor’s hor- riﬁed gaze into the monster’s face. We read all the stories in the novel as if a hand is over our eyes, too, and at any moment it will be lifted and the novel will transform from something read into something seen — perhaps someone seen in the mirror. But Shelley does not entirely abandon her novel to this logic. Instead of having Walton sign the last letter and thereby complete the Chinese-box structure of her work, she leaves the crucial ﬁnal message from the monster unsigned, hinting that in some way it breaks out of the logic of the Imaginary. The monster gets the last word. Here he explains what I discussed above: that he did not take satisfaction in his crimes, that he is not ethically monstrous. By dispelling the illusion of his enjoyment and emphasizing his own ordinary desire for fellowship, he provides an alternative to Victor’s project. Implicitly, in this ﬁnal speech Shelley answers a question that Victor’s narrative poses. If we are to renounce the illusion of the maternal Thing and of jouissance, what remains to us as subjects? Are we to renounce desire itself and live without hope? The monster’s wish for ordinary life, complete with its attendant frustrations and conﬂicts, suggests that for Shelley, as for Lacan, the best path is to afﬁrm the deadlock of ordinary desire ratherZ94 PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM than seeking to escape it through any kind of utopian condition (cf. Ethics 291-301). Insofar as desire is always oriented toward a lost ob- ject, it is best to afﬁrm the wish for that as well — even if in the knowl- edge that it is forever lost. How does such an answer bear upon the many political questions that this novel raises? As I have argued, the creature is (like) a woman; others have shown how he is also a racially marked person, a revolution- ary or member of a radical mob, a member of the working class, and a sexual deviant. He can represent so many possibilities only because in his monstrosity “he can stand for everything that our culture has to repress” (Dolar 19). The monster is not any one of these things, nor can culture exorcise him by addressing any one political problem. Rather, the creature reveals the general structure of ideological projection per se, the abstract category by virtue of which ideology can operate. Thus “psychoanalysis differs from other interpretations by its insistence on the formal level of the uncanny rather than on its content” (Dolar 20). Zizek argues, in a discussion of totalitarianism and anti-Semitism, that ideology operates by imagining that some social force — whether Iews, women, workers, blacks, gays — blocks social unity. “Society is not pre- vented from achieving its full identity because of Iews” or any other group but “by its own antagonistic nature, by its own immanent block- age, and it ‘projects’ this internal negativity into the ﬁgure of the ‘Iew’ ”— or, Shelley might add, of the monster (Sublime 127). Shelley, neither an Enlightenment radical in the mode of Victor nor a sentimen- tal conservative in the mode of the Frankenstein family, advocates a self- consciously disillusioned form of ideology critique in which one accepts and afﬁrms the deadlock of social and sexual relations. Long before Lacan, she formulated an ethics for those of us who live after the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, one that relinquishes the dream of emancipation and sustains instead a postutopian form of polit- ical hope.

Feminist criticism comes in many forms, and feminist critics have a variety of goals. Some have been interested in rediscovering the works of women writers overlooked by a masculine-dominated culture. Oth- ers have revisited books by male authors and reviewed them from a woman’s point of view to understand how they both reﬂect and shape the attitudes that have held women back. A number of contemporary feminists have turned to topics as various as women in postcolonial societies, women’s autobiographical writings, lesbians and literature, womanliness as masquerade, and the role of ﬁlm and other popular media in the construction of the feminine gender. Until a few years ago, however, feminist thought tended to be clas- siﬁed not according to topic but, rather, according to country of origin. This practice reﬂected the fact that, during the 1970s and early 1980s, French, American, and British feminists wrote from somewhat different perspectives. French feminists tended to focus their attention on language, ana- lyzing the ways in which meaning is produced. They concluded that language as we commonly think of it is a decidedly male realm. Draw- ing on the ideas of the psychoanalytic philosopher Iacques Lacan, they 296WHAT IS FEMINIST CRITICISM? 297 reminded us that language is a realm of public discourse. A child enters the linguistic realm just as it comes to grasp its separateness from its mother, just about the time that boys identify with their father, the fam- ily representative of culture. The language learned reﬂects a binary logic that opposes such terms as active/passive, masculine/feminine, sun/ moon, father/mother, head/ heart, son/ daughter, intelligent/ sensi- tive, brother/sister, form/ matter, phallus/vagina, reason/ emotion. Because this logic tends to group with masculinity such qualities as light, thought, and activity, French feminists said that the structure of language is phallocentric: it privileges the phallus and, more generally, masculinity by associating them with things and values more appreci- ated by the (masculine-dominated) culture. Moreover, French femi- nists suggested, “masculine desire dominates speech and posits woman as an idealized fantasy-fulﬁllment for the incurable emotional lack caused by separation from the mother” (lones, “Inscribing” 83). French feminists associated language with separation from the mother. Its distinctions, they argued, represent the world from the male point of view. Language systematically forces women to choose: either they can imagine and represent themselves as men imagine and repre- sent them (in which case they may speak, but will speak as men) or they can choose “silence,” becoming in the process “the invisible and unheard sex” (Iones, “Inscribing” 83). But some inﬂuential French feminists maintained that language only seems to give women such a narrow range of choices. There is another possibility, namely, that women can develop a feminine lan- guage. In various ways, early French feminists such as Annie Leclerc, Xaviere Gauthier, and Marguerite Duras suggested that there is some- thing that may be called l’écriture feminine: women’s writing. More recently, Iulia Kristeva has said that feminine language is “semiotic,” not “symbolic.” Rather than rigidly opposing and ranking elements of reality, rather than symbolizing one thing but not another in terms of a third, feminine language is rhythmic and unifying. If from the male per- spective it seems ﬂuid to the point of being chaotic, that is a fault of the male perspective. According to Kristeva, feminine language is derived from the pre- oedipal period of fusion between mother and child. Associated with the maternal, feminine language is not only a threat to culture, which is patriarchal, but also a medium through which women may be creative in new ways. But Kristeva paired her central, liberating claim — that truly feminist innovation in all ﬁelds requires an understanding of the relation between maternity and feminine creation — with a warning. A298 FEMINIST CRITICISM feminist language that refuses to participate in “masculine” discourse, that places its future entirely in a feminine, semiotic discourse, risks being politically marginalized by men. That is to say, it risks being rele- gated to the outskirts (pun intended) of what is considered socially and politically signiﬁcant. Kristeva, who associated feminine writing with the female body, was joined in her views by other leading French feminists. Hélene Cixous, for instance, also posited an essential connection between the woman’s body, whose sexual pleasure has been repressed and denied expression, and women’s writing. “Write your self. Your body must be heard,” Cixous urged; once they learn to write their bodies, women will not only realize their sexuality but enter history and move toward a future based on a “feminine” economy of giving rather than the “masculine” economy of hoarding (Cixous 880). For Luce Irigaray, women’s sexual pleasure (iouissance) cannot be expressed by the dominant, ordered, “logical,” masculine language. Irigaray explored the connection be- tween women’s sexuality and women’s language through the following analogy: as women’s jouissance is more multiple than men’s unitary, phallic pleasure (“woman has sex organs just about everywhere”), so “feminine” language is more diffusive than its “masculine” counter- part. (“That is undoubtedly the reason . . . her language . . . goes off in all directions and . . . he is unable to discern the coherence,” Irigaray writes [This Sex 101-03].) Cixous’s and Irigaray’s emphasis on feminine writing as an expres- sion of the female body drew criticism from other French feminists. Many argued that an emphasis on the body either reduces “the femi- nine” to a biological essence or elevates it in a way that shifts the valua- tion of masculine and feminine but retains the binary categories. For Christine Fauré, Irigaray’s celebration of women’s difference failed to address the issue of masculine dominance, and a Marxist-feminist, Catherine Clément, warned that “poetic” descriptions of what consti- tutes the feminine will not challenge that dominance in the realm of production. The boys will still make the toys, and decide who gets to use them. In her effort to redeﬁne women as political rather than as sex- ual beings, Monique Wittig called for the abolition of the sexual cate- gories that Cixous and Irigaray retained and revalued as they celebrated women’s writing. American feminist critics of the 1970s and early 1980s shared with French critics both an interest in and a cautious distrust of the concept of feminine writing. Annette Kolodny, for instance, worried that the “richness and variety of women’s writing” will be missed if we see in itWHAT IS FEMINIST CRITICISM? 299 only its “feminine mode” or “style” (“Some Notes” 78). And yet Kolodny herself proceeded, in the same essay, to point out that women have had their own style, which includes reﬂexive constructions (“she found herself crying”) and particular, recurring themes (clothing and self-fashioning are mentioned by Kolodny; other American feminists have focused on madness, disease, and the demonic). Interested as they became in the “French” subject of feminine style, American feminist critics began by analyzing literary texts rather than philosophizing abstractly about language. Many reviewed the great works by male writers, embarking on a revisionist rereading of literary tradition. These critics examined the portrayals of women characters, exposing the patriarchal ideology implicit in such works and showing how clearly this tradition of systematic masculine dominance is in- scribed in our literary tradition. Kate Millett, Carolyn Heilbrun, and Iudith Fetterley, among many others, created this model for American feminist criticism, a model that Elaine Showalter came to call “the fem- inist critique” of “male-constructed literary history” (“Poetics” 128). Meanwhile another group of critics including Sandra Gilbert, Susan Gubar, Patricia Meyer Spacks, and Showalter herself created a some- what different model. Whereas feminists writing “feminist critique” analyzed works by men, practitioners of what Showalter used to refer to as “gynocriticism” studied the writings of those women who, against all odds, produced what she calls “a literature of their own.” In The Female I magination (1975), Spacks examined the female literary tradi- tion to ﬁnd out how great women writers across the ages have felt, per- ceived themselves, and imagined reality. Gilbert and Gubar, in The Madwoman in the Attic (1979), concerned themselves with well- known women writers of the nineteenth century, but they too found that general concerns, images, and themes recur, because the authors that they wrote about lived “in a culture whose fundamental deﬁnitions of literary authority” were “both overtly and covertly patriarchal” (45-46). If one of the purposes of gynocriticism was to (re)study well-known women authors, another was to rediscover women’s history and cul- ture, particularly women’s communities that nurtured female creativity. Still another related purpose was to discover neglected or forgotten women writers and thus to forge an alternative literary tradition, a canon that better represents the female perspective by better represent- ing the literary works that have been written by women. Showalter, in A Literature of Their Own (1977), admirably began to fulﬁll this pur- pose, providing a remarkably comprehensive overview of women’s300 FEMINIST CRITICISM writing through three of its phases. She deﬁned these as the “Feminine, Feminist, and Female” phases, phases during which women ﬁrst imitated a masculine tradition (1840-80), then protested against its standards and values (1880-1920), and ﬁnally advocated their own autonomous, female perspective (1920 to the present). With the recovery of a body of women’s texts, attention returned to a question raised in 1978 by Lillian Robinson: Shouldn’t feminist criti- cism need to formulate a theory of its own practice? Won’t reliance on theoretical assumptions, categories, and strategies developed by men and associated with nonfeminist schools of thought prevent feminism from being accepted as equivalent to these other critical discourses? Not all American feminists came to believe that a special or unifying theory of feminist practice was urgently needed; Showalter’s historical approach to women’s culture allowed a feminist critic to use theories based on nonfeminist disciplines. Kolodny advocated a “playful plural- ism” that encompasses a variety of critical schools and methods. But Iane Marcus and others responded that if feminists adopt too wide a range of approaches, they may relax the tensions between feminists and the educational establishment necessary for political activism. The question of whether feminism weakens or fortiﬁes itself by emphasizing its separateness — and by developing unity through sepa- rateness — was one of several areas of debate within American femi- nism during the 1970s and early 1980s. Another area of disagreement touched on earlier, between feminists who stress universal feminine attributes (the feminine imagination, feminine writing) and those who focus on the political conditions experienced by certain groups of women at certain times in history, paralleled a larger distinction between American feminist critics and their British counterparts. While it gradually became customary to refer to an Anglo-American tradition of feminist criticism, British feminists tended to distinguish themselves from what they saw as an American overemphasis on texts linking women across boundaries and decades and an underemphasis on popular art and culture. They regarded their own critical practice as more political than that of North American feminists, whom they some- times faulted for being uninterested in historical detail. They joined such American critics as Myra Iehlen in suggesting that a continuing preoccu- pation with women writers may bring about the dangerous result of placing women’s texts outside the history that conditions them. British feminists felt that the American opposition to male stereo- types that denigrate women often leads to counterstereotypes of femi- nine virtue that ignore real differences of race, class, and culture amongWHAT IS FEMINIST CRITICISM? 301 women. In addition, they argued that American celebrations of individ- ual heroines falsely suggest that powerful individuals may be immune to repressive conditions and may even imply that any individual can go through life unconditioned by the culture and ideology in which she or he lives. Similarly, the American endeavor to recover women’s history — for example, by emphasizing that women developed their own strategies to gain power within their sphere — was seen by British feminists like Iudith Newton and Deborah Rosenfelt as an endeavor that “mystiﬁes” male oppression, disguising it as something that has created for women a special world of opportunities. More important from the British standpoint, the universalizing and “essentializing” tendencies in both American practice and French theory disguise women’s oppression by highlighting sexual difference, suggesting that a dominant system is impervious to political change. By contrast, British feminist theory emphasized an engagement with historical process in order to promote social change. By now the French, American, and British approaches have so thor- oughly critiqued, inﬂuenced, and assimilated one another that the work of most Western practitioners is no longer easily identiﬁable along national boundary lines. Instead, it tends to be characterized according to whether the category of woman is the major focus in the exploration of gender and gender oppression or, alternatively, whether the interest in sexual difference encompasses an interest in other differences that also deﬁne identity. The latter paradigm encompasses the work of femi- nists of color, Third World (preferably called postcolonial) feminists, and lesbian feminists, many of whom have asked whether the universal category ofwoman constructed by certain French and North American predecessors is appropriate to describe women in minority groups or non-Western cultures. These feminists stress that, while all women are female, they are something else as well (such as African-American, lesbian, Muslim Pak- istani). This “something else” is precisely what makes them, their prob- lems, and their goals different from those of other women. As Armit Wilson has pointed out, Asian women living in Britain are expected by their families and communities to preserve Asian cultural traditions; thus, the expression of personal identity through clothing involves a much more serious infraction of cultural rules than it does for a Western woman. Gloria Anzaldua has spoken personally and eloquently about the experience of many women on the margins of Eurocentric North302 FEMINIST CRITICISM American culture. “I am a border woman,” she writes in Borderlands: La Frontera = The New Mestiza (1987). “I grew up between two cul- tures, the Mexican (with a heavy Indian inﬂuence) and the Anglo. . . . Living on the borders and in margins, keeping intact one’s shifting and multiple identity and integrity is like trying to swim in a new element, an ‘alien’ element” (i). Instead of being divisive and isolating, this evolution of feminism into feminisms has fostered a more inclusive, global perspective. The era of recovering women’s texts — especially texts by white Western women — has been succeeded by a new era in which the goal is to recover entire cultures of women. Two important ﬁgures of this new era are Trinh T. Minh-ha and Gayatri Spivak. Spivak, in works such as In Other Worlds: Essays in Cultural Politics (1987) and Outside in the Teaching Machine (1993), has shown how political independence (gen- erally looked upon by metropolitan Westerners as a simple and beneﬁ- cial historical and political reversal) has complex implications for “subaltern” or subproletarian women. The understanding of woman not as a single, deterministic category but rather as the nexus of diverse experiences has led some white, West- ern, “majority” feminists like Iane Tompkins and Nancy K. Miller to advocate and practice “personal” or “autobiographical” criticism. Once reluctant to inject themselves into their analyses for fear of being labeled idiosyncratic, impressionistic, and subjective by men, some fem- inists are now openly skeptical of the claims to reason, logic, and objec- tivity that have been made in the past by male critics. With the advent of more personal feminist critical styles has come a powerful new interest in women’s autobiographical writings. Shari Benstock, who has written personal criticism in her book Tex- tualizing the Feminine (1991), was one of the ﬁrst feminists to argue that traditional autobiography is a gendered, “masculinist” genre. Its established conventions, feminists have recently pointed out, call for a life-plot that turns on action, triumph through conﬂict, intellectual self- discovery, and often public renown. The body, reproduction, children, and intimate interpersonal relationships are generally well in the back- ground and often absent. Arguing that the lived experiences of women and men differ — women’s lives, for instance, are often characterized by interruption and deferral — Leigh Gilmore has developed a theory of women’s self-representation in her book Autobiographics: A Femi- nist Theory of Self-Representation (1994). Autobiographics and personal criticism are only two of a number of recent developments in contemporary feminist criticism. OthersWHAT IS FEMINIST CRITICISM? 303 alluded to in the ﬁrst paragraph of this introduction — lesbian studies, performance or “masquerade” theory, and studies of the role played by ﬁlm and various other “technologies” in shaping gender today — are so prominent in contemporary gender criticism that they are discussed in a separate introduction (see “What Is Gender Criticism?” pp. 334-45 in this volume). Although that introduction will outline several of the differences between the feminist and gender approaches, the fact of this overlap should remind us that categories obscure similarities even as they help us make distinctions. Feminist criticism is, after all, a form of gender criticism, and gender criticism as we have come to know it could never have developed without feminist criticism. Iohanna M. Smith begins the essay that follows by discussing the nineteenth-century doctrine of “separate spheres” (p. 313), which worked to keep middle-class women at home maintaining a household, raising children, and creating a reenergizing refuge from the workplace for their husbands. So many women characters in Frankenstein embrace the domestic life that the novel might seem to advocate the doctrine of separate spheres, but in fact, as Smith points out, it ultimately critiques both “ ‘the feminine sphere of domesticity’ ” and its counterpart, “ ‘the masculine sphere of discovery’ ” (p. 315). Smith grounds the terms of that critique in Mary Shelley’s dual identity as an author (indeed, as the daughter of authors) and as the wife of a famous writer, Percy Bysshe Shelley. Smith provides numerous examples both of the tension between those two roles — for instance, Mary’s decision to write but to publish anonymously— and of the “negotiations” required of a woman writer (p. 315). (As an example of the attempt to negotiate or resolve the tensions between her gender- coded roles and the public and private spheres, Smith cites Mary’s will- ingness to let Percy edit Frankenstein, thereby allowing the novel to become a collaborative effort, however slightly so.) Turning her attention from author to text, Smith ﬁnds the same sorts of tensions and negotiations in Frankenstein. She ﬁnds them in Victor’s father, Alphonse, whose gentle rule at home makes him some- thing of a “feminine patriarch” (p. 317), and in Henry Clerval “a model of internalized complementarity, of conjoined masculine and feminine traits” (p. 318). Most important, she ﬁnds them in Victor’s “conﬂicted” attitude (p. 319) toward what he describes as the “secluded and domestic” life he experienced as a child, the “cooped up” (p. 51) state deemed natural for children as well as for women by the doctrine of separate spheres.304 FEMINIST CRITICISM Although some men and women are able successfully to negotiate, respectively, their way into the realm of public adventure and achieve- ment on one hand, or peace with themselves as they remain conﬁned in its gender-coded alternative on the other, Victor Frankenstein is not among them. In addition to doing the bad work of using science to cre- ate a monster, he becomes, in turn, the epitome of the “bad father,” demanding rather than deserving gratitude and abandoning rather than supporting his “ ‘child’ ” (p. 320). Smith suggests that the failure of his “domestic instruction” to “produce a better Victor” (p. 318) may be read as an implicit if incomplete critique of the doctrine of separate spheres. When Smith turns her attention to science, we might expect to read that science is a masculine undertaking in the public arena of discovery. Instead Smith distinguishes between kinds of science, using Thomas Kuhn’s concept of paradigm shifts and Michel Foucault’s concept of a genealogy of subjugated knowledges to suggest that the transition from alchemy (Victor’s father calls it “sad trash” [p. 46]) and the work of the “electricians” to modern chemistry as understood by Erasmus Darwin and Humphry Davy is a scientiﬁc paradigm shift (324). Thus, alchemy and the science of the electricians are subjugated knowledges that have, as it were, been domesticated and feminized in the sense that they have been declared off-limits in the public life of masculine knowledges. Victor’s transition from alchemy to modern science is “incomplete” (p. 325), Smith argues, and because he (not unlike his author, who was similarly torn between spheres deemed irreconcilable by many) has not yet left the old paradigm behind, he retires with his modern knowledge of chemistry to what he calls the “solitary chamber” of alchemy to cre- ate a monster whose subsequent rebellion may be seen as analogous to Mary Shelley’s incipient but incomplete rebellion against and transition from the doctrine of separate spheres. Thus, according to Smith, a “feminist adaptation of Kuhn’s and Foucault’s ideas can show” that, “as the monster enacts Victor’s rebellion against domesticity, he also enacts the insurrection of subjugated sciences” (pp. 325-26). Smith’s essay exempliﬁes feminist criticism in a number of ways. Her analysis of Mary Shelley as a novelist and wife advances the historic interest of French and American feminists in women’s writing and writ- ers. Her emphasis on the role played by culturally pervasive ideologies in shaping the experiences of women and women writers (according to their social class) and the content and structure of literary texts advances the historical interest of British feminism and of cultural femi- nist criticism. Smith’s essay exempliﬁes contemporary feminist thoughtA SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY 305 insofar as it overlaps with gender criticism, whose practitioners tend to be less interested in “essential” differences between women and men than in the gender-coded differences that society constructs and imposes (through such mechanisms as the nineteenth-century doctrine of separate spheres). Equally contemporary — and equally relevant to gender theory — is the emphasis Smith places on science, a form of knowledge that has played no small role in defining and perpetuating gender differences but whose paradigms, as Smith suggests, can be adapted to serve the ends of feminist analysis, feminist critique.

A FEMINIST PERSPECTIVE IOHANNA M. SMITH “Cooped Up” with “Sad Trash”: Domesticity and the Sciences in Frankenstein It is important to note that Frankenstein was published anony- mously, that its woman author kept her identity hidden. Similarly, no women in the novel speak directly: everything we hear from and about them is ﬁltered through the three male narrators. In addition, these women seldom venture far from home, while the narrators and most of the novel’s other men engage in quests and various public occupations. These facts exemplify the nineteenth century’s emerging concept of separate spheres, a concept that itself exempliﬁes a middle-class ideol- ogy of domesticity. That is, as the man’s public sphere of commerce and activity was kept distinct from the woman’s private sphere of home and passivity, and as certain traits (such as aggression) were coded as “natu- rally” masculine while the complementary traits (such as nurturance) were coded as “naturally” feminine, the woman’s sphere and attributes were delimited to the domestic. I begin by discussing the workings of this ideology where one might expect to ﬁnd them, in the life of the314 FEMINIST CRITICISM woman writer Mary Shelley and in the domestic relations of her novel Frankenstein. I then go on to show how the binaries which structure the ideology of separate spheres also structure the contemporary sci- ence that Frankenstein critiques. First, some caveats. Recently some feminist scholars have argued that the focus on separate spheres which has long characterized feminist criticism has outlived its usefulness. Certainly it is true that upper-class women were less restricted by this ideology than middle-class women, and working-class women continued to do paid work outside the home; indeed, the domestic sphere of upper- and middle-class ladies was maintained by the labor of working-class women, especially that of their servants. It is also true that some middle-class women were able to turn an ideology of domesticity to limited account in the public sphere: by a sort of extended domesticity which validated their reform- ing work in such public institutions as workhouses and prisons, and by writing novels which “participate[d] in national issues . . .otherwise conducted by men” (Kelly 200). By and large, however, middle-class women were expected to maintain a home for their menfolk. And that home was to be not only, as one of domesticity’s stoutest ideologues put it, “a relief from the severer duties of life,” but also a protection from the taint of those duties (Sarah Ellis 12); a man could thus “pur- sue the necessary avocation of the day” but also “keep as it were a sepa- rate soul for his family, his social duty, and his God” (Sarah Ellis 20). Hence it seems to me still useful to explore the problems that such ide- ological expectations posed for some women. We might infer from Frankenstein’s women that Mary Shelley accepted and even approved the concept of separate and gendered spheres; Elizabeth in particular is a veritable catalog of ideologically sound feminine qualities. Yet it is also true that Elizabeth and the domestic sphere she represents fail signally in their raison d’étre, which is to prepare young men like Victor Frankenstein to resist the tempta- tions of the public sphere. The novel shows that the private virtues inculcated in the home by the domestic affections cannot arm men against the public sphere unless they emulate these feminine and do- mestic qualities. And while Victor often reiterates his “warmest admira- tion” (p. 133 in this volume) for Elizabeth’s qualities, he perceives them not as his model but as a “reward” and “consolation” for his trials (p. 135). Similarly, while he may wax eloquent on the domestic “lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control” taught him as a child (p. 42), his quest for scientiﬁc glory demonstrates that none of this lesson took. These contradictions may suggest that domestic affection can instill itsJOHANNA M. SMITH 315 lessons only if it is “hardy enough to survive in the world outside the home” (Kate Ellis 140), but Frankenstein also dramatizes how difﬁcult is that achievement. From this point of view, Frankenstein may be said to critique a bifurcated social order “that separates ‘outer’ and ‘inner,’ the masculine sphere of discovery and the feminine sphere of domestic- ity” (Kate Ellis 124). How could the home be both a nursery of public virtue and a shelter from the public sphere? Indeed, what would be the use of the “separate soul” touted by Sarah Ellis if its qualities were never activated in/ for the public sphere? Although an ideology of domesticity attempts to paper over such contradictions, they are glaringly repre- sented in the Victor Frankenstein who “procrastinate[s] all that related to my feelings of affection” (p. 59) for home and family in order to pur- sue masculine scientiﬁc labors in the public sphere. Similar contradictions appear in Mary Shelley’s negotiations be- tween public and private in her career as a woman writer. In her 1831 introduction to Frankenstein, she recalls that her private, domestic role —“the cares of a family” (p. 21) — long kept her from fulﬁlling her desire for the public fame her parents had won through writing. Even when she went public with Frankenstein in 1818, she remained to some extent private by publishing it anonymously. Some of this desire for privacy may have been due to Mary’s various family relations. She was certainly aware of the contumely directed at her mother’s uncon- ventional life and at both her parents for their radical writing, and her husband Percy and their friend Lord Byron had been similarly viliﬁed for their lives and work. After her elopement Mary had come in for her own share of public comment on her private life, such as the rumors, which she knew of, that her father had sold her to Percy (Letters 1.4). Furthermore, “as the daughter of two literary celebrities” (May 493) Mary at birth “immediately entered the speculative economy of the marketplace”; publishing anonymously, then, may have reduced the pressure of expectations on “a name so heavily intertextualized” (Duyfhuizen 477). In conjunction with these personal reasons for desiring privacy, however, may well have been cultural pressures, gen- dered expectations about women’s writings. The negotiations necessary for a woman to write her way into the public sphere are hinted in the history of a letter Mary wrote to Percy on 30 September 1817. On this date Frankenstein was with the pub- lisher, halfway between a private and a public state; Percy, not Mary, was in London editing the proofs. In her letter Mary animadverted at length on the politics of a pamphlet by the radical William Cobbett, and Percy apparently showed these private comments on public affairs to316 FEMINIST CRITICISM their mutual friend Leigh Hunt, editor of the weekly Examiner. With- out informing Mary, Hunt then made these comments public by quot- ing them in an editorial. Although he did not name Mary, he did make a point of her gender, describing her as “a lady of what is called a masculine understanding, that is to say, of great natural abilities not obstructed by a bud education” (qtd. in Letters 1.54, fn.2). Mary’s letter reads somewhat breathlessly — like much of the manuscript Frankenstein, for instance, it is punctuated only by dashes — and she felt it “cut a very foolish ﬁgure” in print (1.53). Had she known Hunt would make her remarks public, she told Percy, she would have written with “more print-worthy dignity”; instead, the letter was “so feme- ninely [sic] expressed that all men of letters will on reading it acquit me of having a masculine understanding.” What this incident illuminates is the separate spheres of writing and of literacy. That is, Hunt genders “great natural abilities” as masculine, and such abilities would be showcased in the “print-worthy dignity” of a masculine Latinate prose — the product of a public-school and university education, available at this time only to men, which taught writing on the model of Latin prose. Natural abilities “obstructed” by the “bad” education most women could expect to receive, in con- trast, are feminized — obscured, weakened. Letters in particular were often characterized as “femeninely expressed,” i.e., ill-spelt and ram- bling prattle, and like the private letter, the public genre of the episto- lary novel was “long associated with women’s writing” (Behrendt 71). For Mary Shelley to name herself as Frankenstein’s author, then, might be to endanger her status as honorary man, to risk having her “mascu- line understanding” impugned as “femeninely expressed.” Small won- der that a woman writer, especially a woman writer as visible in the specular and speculative economy of the marketplace as Mary Shelley (May 493), might attempt to evade a harsh judgment from “men of let- ters” by publishing anonymously. Even her apparently straightforward claiming of the novel in her 1831 introduction shows these “tensions between the public Mary Shelley and the private one” (Poovey 1 18), as several feminist critics have pointed out. Stephen Behrendt calls the introduction Mary’s “explicit” and public claim to authorship (84); in contrast, Vanessa Dickerson ﬁnds in it further evidence of authorial “passivity” (80); Veronica Hollinger argues that Mary was indeed “careful to represent herself” as an “acceptable . . . version of the Woman author,” but that this very masquerade, like the “equally con- ventional portraits” of the novel’s women characters, hints that such versions of womanliness are only masquerade, merely an “exemplaryIOHANNA M. SMITH 317 performance created in response to male desire” (2l2-l4). And since we know that Percy Shelley laid a heavy editorial hand on the ﬁrst ver- sions of his wife’s manuscript, one might call the novel itself such a per- formance. It remains important, however, to insist on the tensions of performing gender. In other words, Mary Shelley’s willingness to accept her husband’s editorial revisions is analogous to Frankenstein’s oppressively feminine women: all are efforts to negotiate between pub- lic and private, between masculine understanding and feminine expres- sion, between domestic ideology and domestic practice. I turn now to the novel, to show how domestic relationships in Frankenstein embody this complex and uneasy set of negotiations. At ﬁrst blush, the Frankenstein home seems a model of gender rela- tions under domestic ideology. Not only are Alphonse and Caroline joined in “bonds of devoted affection” (p. 41), they are model parents, “possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence” (p. 45) toward their children. Furthermore, they parent together: they are joint “agents and creators” of Victor’s childhood joys; he derives as much pleasure from his father’s “smile of benevolent pleasure” as from his mother’s “tender caresses”; both parents teach Victor moral lessons of “self-control,” gently guiding him with “a silken cord” (p. 42). This shared parenting suggests that fathers have important functions in the feminine domestic sphere; indeed, I would argue that, as a Good Father, Alphonse is feminized. His nurturant qualities were commonly coded as feminine, and it is signiﬁcant that before his marriage he “relinquished all his public functions” (p. 42) as syndic, and withdrew from the man’s sphere of government into the woman’s sphere of home. And although he played the traditional masculine role of protec- tor by rescuing Caroline from want, after their marriage this role is domesticated when he “shelter[s] her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind” (p. 42). In these ways Alphonse becomes a sort of feminine patriarch, and his gentle rule by “silken cord” is the reverse of paternal tyranny. Also ideologically sound is the harmony among the household’s children, for it arises from traits that are gendered as opposite yet com- plementary. This emphasis on gender harmony is particularly apparent in several of Mary’s revisions. In her rough draft, for instance, an elec- trical storm produced “a very different effect” on each child: Victor wanted “to analyze its causes,” his friend Henry Clerval “said that the fairies and giants were at war,” and Elizabeth “attempted a picture of it” (Robinson 36). Although such differences are retained in the 1831 Frankenstein, the focus shifts to Victor and Elizabeth, and to how318 FEMINIST CRITICISM “diversity and contrast . . . drew us nearer together” (p. 44). For ex- ample, Elizabeth “contemplate[s] with a serious and satisﬁed spirit” the appearance of things while Victor “delight[s] in investigating their causes,” but no “disunion or dispute” ensues (p. 44). Throughout the novel, such gendered differences — here, between feminine passivity and masculine activity — are represented as complementary. Thus, al- though young Victor and Henry actively prepare for public futures while Elizabeth simply exists “like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home” (p. 45), what might seem an opposition between the separate gendered spheres is rewritten as complementary difference. And although Elizabeth is little more than “the living spirit of love to soften and attract,” as such she performs speciﬁcally feminine functions for her men. Her “sympathy,” smile, “sweet glance,” etc., are “ever there to bless and animate” the boys; she teaches Henry “the real love- liness of beneﬁcence”; crucially, her very presence “subdue[s]” Victor to “a semblance of her own gentleness” (p. 46). If Elizabeth’s femininity is a complement to the boys’ masculinity, Henry is a model of internalized complementarity, of conjoined mascu- line and feminine traits. When Victor is ill at Ingolstadt, Henry takes the role of “kind and attentive nurse” (p. 64) that Elizabeth wished for herself (p. 65). Although Henry aspires to be numbered among the “adventurous benefactors of our species,” this masculine “passion for adventurous exploit” is tempered when Elizabeth directs his “soaring ambition” toward “doing good” (p. 46). Unlike Victor’s “mad enthu- siasm” (p. 158), in short, Henry’s “wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart” (p. 137). Clearly, Victor’s “eager desire” to learn “the physical secrets of the world” should have been balanced by Henry’s preoccupation with “the moral relations of things” (p. 45, emphases added). Why, then, does this enclave of domestic virtues not produce a bet- ter Victor? Why does he not proﬁt from the “lesson of patience, of char- ity, of self-control” taught by his model parents and embodied in Elizabeth and Henry? Why does he not remain within the boundaries marked off by the “silken cord” of domestic instruction and affection? To ask these questions, of course, is to buy into a “great myth of the Enlightenment” (Rowen 46), the myth of human capacity to be per- fected by education and nurture. This myth of perfectibility is central to the politics of Mary Shelley’s parents, and while she was skeptical of such optimism her work throughout is deeply engaged with the problematic of education. Hence it is worth asking why Victor’s domestic education was so signal a failure, and I approach the questionJOHANNA M. SMITH 319 via Victor’s complicated relations to feminine domesticity and mascu- line science. COOPED UP Despite Victor’s insistence on his perfect childhood, his reaction to this “remarkably secluded and domestic” home life (p. 51) is in fact conﬂicted. On the one hand, he is “reluctant” to leave home for univer- sity, because there he will have to be “[his] own protector”; on the other hand, he has often felt “cooped up” at home and has “longed to enter the world” (p. 51). This admission jars, especially when one com- pares it with Victor’s earlier statement that “gratitude” to his parents “assisted the development of ﬁlial love” (p. 45). I want to argue, how- ever, that it is this very gratitude which makes him feel “cooped up.” Gratitude, no matter how heartfelt, implies obligation to the benefac- tor, which in turn implies that the benefactor is one up until the debt of gratitude is discharged. It also implies the need to keep track of one’s obligations, and most of the relations in the novel are permeated by this bookkeeping mentality. Grateful for Henry’s nursing, Victor asks “How shall I ever repay you?” (p. 65); Felix De Lacey sees Saﬁe as the “treasure” that will “fully reward his toil and hazard” in rescuing her father (p. I1I); even the creature fumes when “the reward of [his] benevolence” in saving the drowning girl turns out to be “ingratitude” (p. 125). This emotional quid pro quo is most evident, however, in the novel’s domestic relations. In this sense the Frankenstein family is “a paradigm of the social contract based on economic terms” (Dussinger 52), for kinship and domestic affection are “secondary to the indebted- ness incurred by promises exchanged for gifts.” That is, in this family what seems freely given in fact requires something in exchange, so that the relation between parents and children is one of “unpayable debt.” Rather than Victor’s picture of “bonds of devoted affection” and a “silken cord” of guidance, then, what emerges is a pattern of constrict- ing domestic relations. Among the Frankensteins, a gift requires grati- tude and so produces a sense of obligation, a debt that can be discharged only by endless repetitions of this pattern. Consider Victor’s description of the parent-child relation. I was . . . their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulﬁlled their duties towards me. With this deep320 FEMINIST CRITICISM consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, . . . while . . . I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord, that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me. (p. 42, emphases added) Alphonse and Caroline pay off their debt of gratitude to “Heaven” by fulﬁlling the duties they owe their child. Victor in turn owes gratitude for the life they have given him and for their care, and this obligation forms the cord that, no matter how silken, conﬁnes him within the fam- ily. Hence he repeats this pattern when he contemplates creating a new species. The members of his species “would owe their being to me,” he gloats, and thus “No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs” (p. 58, emphases added). The distinction Victor makes here, between really deserving gratitude and merely claiming it, is important because it indicates the difference between a good father and a bad one. A good father, like Alphonse, ful- ﬁlls his duties to his child and thus deserves its gratitude; a bad father, like Victor, does not fulﬁll his duties and in fact abandons his “child,” so he may claim gratitude but does not in fact deserve it. Furthermore, bad father Victor produces a bad son, not the embodied ﬁlial gratitude he had hoped for but rather “my own spirit . . . forced to destroy all that was dear to me” (p. 76). It might seem that the creature’s rampage against Victor’s dear ones is the opposite of good son Victor’s gratitude toward his loving family and its feminized patriarch. But if the creature is Victor’s “own spirit”— the bad son lurking within the good son — and if bad sons are produced by bad fathers, then is Alphonse somehow a bad father? To ask this question is again to teeter on the brink of the Enlightenment myth of nurture, to suggest that parents make or create their children and are therefore responsible for the child who turns out badly. Frankenstein, I think, does show the importance of parental nur- ture, but it does not thereby absolve the child of agency in, and respon- sibility for, what we might call self-creation or self-nurture. But even if Alphonse is not a bad father, questions remain about a domestic ideol- ogy in which the novel is so invested but which so spectacularly fails. Is there in fact something destructive about the good domesticity Mary Shelley seems to advocate? Thomas Dutoit claims that “the real monster” in this novel is “the domestic scene and its discourse on virtue, happiness, and affection”— speciﬁcally, its “ﬁction of the do- mestic union of happiness and virtue” (867) — and many feminist crit- ics agree. Sarah Goodwin points out that “violence is at the heart ofJOHANNA M. SMITH 321 every home in the novel” and that the monster “gives expression” to this “repressed violence in the home” (100, 101). Hollinger argues that the novel’s violence results partly from “the repression required to internalize the masquerade” of femininity, and that the creature “destroys precisely those realms of the domestic most closely associated with conventional femininity” (210, 212). This last point is made obvi- ous in the creature’s victims: young William living at home under Eliza- beth’s care, the servant Iustine whose devotion to her mistress and resignation to her fate embody class, as well as gender-speciﬁc domestic subordination, Henry the paradigm of masculine and feminine traits in harmony, Elizabeth the domestic icon, Alphonse the feminized patri- arch. In this sense, as Victor’s murderous “spirit” the monster reveals the dark side of the Frankenstein family’s oppressive domesticity. Even before the monster’s outbreak, however, we can see this dark side in the relations of Caroline Beaufort, Elizabeth Lavenza, and Ius- tine Moritz to the Frankensteins. In the ﬁrst place, it is class selection that determines which women are tapped to enter the upper-class Frankenstein family. Although plunged into straw-plaiting poverty by her father’s business failure, Caroline’s lineage and beauty mark her as still deserving the “rank and magniﬁcence” (p. 40) he once enjoyed; by marrying her, then, Alphonse is restoring the status quo, rescuing Car- oline from a working-class milieu and returning her to her proper place. Furthermore, as Anca Vlasopolos points out, such “aristocratic pro- tectionism . . . encourages, in fact engineers, incest” (126) by closing the family off from otherness or difference. This pattern is especially overt in the adoption of Elizabeth. Because Elizabeth is a nobleman’s daughter, visibly “of a different stock” f'om her rude guardians (p. 43), Caroline rescues her from the lower orders; under the “powerful pro- tection” (p. 43) of the Frankenstein family, Elizabeth rapidly becomes Victor’s “more than sister” (p. 44). Difference is further excluded as Elizabeth takes on all the family’s feminine roles: Victor’s quasi sister and destined to be his wife, after Caroline’s death Elizabeth takes her “place” as his mother (p. 50). Although Iustine is brought less fully into the family, she is perhaps the most Frankensteinized: when Caro- line rescues her from her mother, Iustine so “imitate[s] her phraseology and manners” (p. 67) as to become her clone. The Frankenstein fam- ily’s incestuous pattern of reproducing itself by excluding difference could hardly be clearer. This insistent replication of the domestic icon also shows how com- pletely and destructively the pattern of indebtedness permeates the Frankenstein deﬁnition of femininity. That is, although the Frankenstein322 FEMINIST CRITICISM family opens to receive these three, they then become subject to its gratitude/ obligation debt economy and its pattern of repetitions. We ﬁrst see Caroline as a daughter, discharging her obligations to her father, and it is the tableau of her paying her last respects that ﬁrst capti- vates Alphonse. After he becomes her “protecting spirit,” she almost literally owes all she has to this marriage, and the benevolence with which he “shelter[s]” and “surround[s]” her further enjoins gratitude (p. 42). As Caroline tries to discharge her obligations by “act[ing] in her turn the guardian angel to the afﬂicted” (p. 42) — that is, by becoming a Frankenstein — her benevolence takes the usual form of the “gift” that induces obligation and requires gratitude. When she gives Iustine an education, for instance, “This beneﬁt was fully repaid,” for Iustine becomes “the most grateful little creature in the world” (p. 67). Eventually, however, when she acts the guardian angel by nurs- ing Elizabeth, Caroline discharges her debt with her own life. Eliza- beth, indebted to Caroline for rescue from peasant life, then discharges this debt by taking Caroline’s place as the Frankenstein ideal of femi- ninity. Victor’s dream, that his kiss kills Elizabeth and turns her into his dead mother, is proleptic of the price she will pay. Iustine is perhaps the most pathetic victim of this pattern of replicated femininity. Exhausted by her Caroline-like maternal care in searching for William, she falls asleep; her likeness to the miniature of Caroline reminds the monster of all women’s indifference to him, and in a rage he plants the miniature on her; it becomes circumstantial evidence of the crime for which Ius- tine is convicted, “blackest ingratitude” (p. 82) toward her benefactors. Like Caroline and Elizabeth, Iustine pays her obligations to the Frankenstein with her life, and furthermore dies all but convinced that she is in fact a “monster” (p. 83) of ingratitude. The domestic enclave of affective relations turns out to be not an alternative to but a mirror of the public sphere of economic relations. My ﬁnal example of this pattern is the female monster whom Victor creates and destroys in a kind of parody of Frankensteinian benevo- lence. The monster’s desire for a mate “as hideous as myself ” (p. 129) is an “ironic repetition” (Vine 253) of Victor’s desire for Elizabeth, “the material form of his ideal self-representation”; and because Victor destroys the monsterette, the monster retaliates by destroying Eliza- beth. Of course, Victor assumed that he rather than Elizabeth would be the monster’s target, and in one sense he is correct: Elizabeth dies not because she is Elizabeth but because she is the object of Victor’s desire. In other words, just as women are interchangeable within the domesticJOHANNA M. SMITH 323 circle, here Elizabeth and the monsterette are simply counters in the struggle between Victor and the monster. Like Elizabeth's, the mon- sterette’s creation and destruction dramatize how women function not in their own right but rather as signs of and conduits for men’s relations with other men." Before leaving this thematic of domesticity, it is worth discussing the monsterette and Safie as examples of the otherness that the Frankenstein family circle works so hard to exclude. I have been stress- ing the interchangeability of Elizabeth and the monsterette, but there is one difference between them, at least in Victor’s mind: while Eliza- beth is firmly located in the family circle of replication and controlled desire, a monsterette “might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation” (p. 144), might desire where she shouldn’t, might in short become “an independent site of production” (Vine 256). This unpredictability connects her with another outsider: the Arabian Safie, whose “independence of spirit” (p. 112) leads her to defy her father’s “tyrannical mandate” (p. 114) and travel across Europe to rejoin Felix. And like the monsterette’s, albeit less drastically, Safie’s independence is neutralized; the challenge she might otherwise represent to a do- mestic ideology is in effect “absorbed” by various cultural norms (Vla- sopolos 132). For one thing, her desire to marry Felix is acceptable in class terms, for she finds “enchanting” the prospect of “tak[ing] a rank in society” (p. 112); it is also acceptable in the terms of a “European ‘Orientalist’ construction of the East” (Zonana 173), for she chooses Felix in part to avoid “returning to Asia, and being immured within the walls of a haram” (p. 112). In addition, unlike Henry or Walton, Safie seeks adventure not for its own sake or to benefit humankind but to get a man. It is thus apt that she joins the De Lacey family, for while their interactive domestic style stands in stark contrast to the rigid gift/debt structure of the Frankensteins, it is nonetheless a con- ventionally middle-class separate-spheres arrangement: Felix is “em- ployed out of doors” (p. 101), for instance, while his sister Agatha’s work consists of “arranging the cottage” (p. 101). Finally, just as Vic- tor’s family takes in only a select few women, so the De Lacey family circle opens only to admit the beautiful Safie. That Felix, like Victor, excludes the ugly monster indicates again how strictly men control the domestic sphere. "For analyses of other works that enact this traffic in women, see Sedgwick.324 FEMINIST CRITICISM SAD TRASH This section covers the kinds of scientiﬁc knowledge the novel explores: the alchemical sciences of Albertus Magnus, Paracelsus, and Cornelius Agrippa that Victor’s father dismisses as “sad trash” (p. 46); the experiments of the “electricians,” late-eighteenth-century scientists testing the powers and uses of electricity; and the modern chemistry, modeled on the work of Erasmus Darwin and Humphry Davy, that Victor embraces. The masculinism of Victor’s science has been exhaustively argued by Aime Mellor, and I have made this argu- ment myself. But one could also make the case, as Crosbie Smith does, that Frankenstein is less anti-science than “structured by powerful ten- sions” (39) among kinds of science: “the textual lore of Paracelsianism” (Schaffer 93), the spectacular demonstrations of the “electricians,” and the achievements of modern chemistry. Hence Mary Shelley’s novel is not “a simple moralistic tale of masculinist, scientiﬁc overreaching” (Iordanova 60); rather it is an exploration of “different modes of knowledge” (74), of “practices that manipulated nature,” of “the desire for mastery.”2 Hence too, we can see that Victor’s attempt to leave behind a domestic life is also an effort to leave behind the sad trash of alchemy, and that his attempt to move into a public life is also an effort at mastery over masculine scientiﬁc knowledges. Developing these parallels will reveal that, just as the ideology of domesticity rele- gates certain qualities to the devalued feminine sphere, so modern sci- ence relegates other kinds of science to the realm of “sad trash.” To trace Victor’s move from alchemy to chemistry is thus to trace the ten- sions and conﬂicts of contemporary gendered science. I approach these tensions and conﬂicts with the help of two theo- retical models: Thomas Kuhn’s concept of paradigm shifts in scientiﬁc knowledge and Michel Foucault’s concept of a genealogy of subjugated knowledges. Kuhn deﬁnes a paradigm as a “model from which spring particular coherent traditions of scientiﬁc research” (11); texts such as Antoine Lavoisier’s Chemistry provide successful paradigms because they “deﬁne the legitimate problems and methods of a research ﬁeld” (Kuhn 10). A successful paradigm in turn affects “the structure of the group that practices the ﬁeld” (18), since there is now a “more rigid deﬁnition of the ﬁeld” itself (19). Those practitioners who reject the new paradigm are “read out of the profession” and their form of sci- 2See “A Critical History of Frankenstein” (pp. 237-61) for other forms of science operating in the novel.I01-[ANNA M. SMITH 325 ence is marginalized; in contrast, researchers who share the paradigm also share “the same rules and standards for scientiﬁc practice” (l1), and that consensus enables “normal science,” or “the genesis and con- tinuation of a particular research tradition.” But any paradigm has a limited utility; hence the second element of Kuhn’s thesis, the paradigm shift. An anomaly of some sort emerges that cannot be accommodated by the current dominant paradigm; an increased “professional aware- ness” (67) of that anomaly then induces “a state of growing crisis”; the crisis, however, “loosens the rules of normal puzzle-solving in ways that ultimately permit a new paradigm to emerge” (80). Once this paradigm shift has occurred, it “necessitates a redeﬁnition” (103) of the pertinent science that constitutes a “scientiﬁc revolution” (90). That is, “[t]he transition from a paradigm in crisis to a new one” (84) involves “a reconstruction of the ﬁeld from new fundamentals,” as a result of which the “old problems” may be relegated to another science or to the cate- gory of the “unscientiﬁc.” Despite the metaphor of revolution, how- ever, Kuhn here suggests a transition between rather than a struggle of knowledges, and to foreground this element of struggle I turn to my second theoretical model, Foucault’s genealogy of subjugated knowl- edges. A genealogy in Foucault’s sense is not so much a history as a tac- tic or a strategy: genealogies function to oppose “the effects of the centralising powers which are linked to the institution and function of an organized scientiﬁc discourse” (83). In this sense a genealogy is “an insurrection of subjugated knowledges” (81), “a return of knowledge[s]” which had been “disqualiﬁed” as “popular,” or as “inadequate to their task,” or as “beneath the required level of cognition or scientiﬁcity.” What is the relevance of all this for Frankenstein? Kuhn’s example of preparadigm science is the researches of “electricians” in the ﬁrst half of the eighteenth century; his example of paradigm science is the modern, post-Lavoisier chemistry which emerged from that research and which so entrances Victor. Thus Victor’s move from alchemy to chemistry via the electricians is a paradigm shift in miniature. But as natural philoso- phy was systematized into the study of the laws ofnature, searches into “hidden and ultimate causes” (Smith 41) rather than laws were increas- ingly “assigned to an ancient metaphysics” such as natural magic or alchemy. As Victor continues to “investigat[e the] causes” of things (42), then, his paradigm shift is incomplete. Furthermore, alchemy and the researches of the electricians become what Kuhn would call superseded paradigms but also what Foucault would call subjugated knowledges. And a feminist adaptation of Kuhn’s and Foucault’s ideas can show how, as the monster enacts the insurrection of subjugated ..I,-_ ' .i~*+‘-"3 26 FEMINIST CRITICISM sciences, he also enacts Victor’s rebellion against domesticity. To see why this is so, we need to begin with Victor’s ﬁrst “preceptors” (45), Paracelsus and Cornelius Agrippa, for if they were alchemists they were also physicians and thus scientists. Paracelsus was “a magician, psychologist, astrologer, diviner, phar- macist, philosopher, metaphysician, teacher, reformer, and alchemist” but “ﬁrst and foremost” a physician (Poncé). He anticipated antisepsis and germ theory, developed mineral medicines to supersede the prevail- ing Galenic organic remedies, invented chemical urinalysis and chemi- cal therapy, and suggested the biochemical theory of digestion. And he developed all this chemical medicine from his “revolutionized . . . alchemical thought” (Poncé); indeed, Paracelsus called alchemy one of the four “fundamental part[s], or pillars, of true medicine” (2.148). It follows that “the stars . . . complete and perfect the work of the physi- cian,” and it also follows that “[i]f you wish to attain the ends you anticipate you must have heaven kindly and benignant to you” (2.149, 151). Victor appears not to have read that far, but he may well have derived from Paracelsus his sense of the alchemist’s power over a femi- nine nature. As Paracelsus puts it, [although] Nature is so keen and subtle in her operations. . . , [s]he brings nothing to the light that is at once perfect in itself, but leaves it to be perfected by man. This method of perfection is called Alchemy. . . . [Its] methods of treatment have rivaled Nature, and have . . . mastered her properties. (2.149) Including Nature’s property of life: “certain medicines” (2.108) pro- tect the body “altogether from diseases,” and there are “means of attaining long life” and of “driving away . . . death” (2.110). Further- more, through his “art and industry” (1.121) the alchemist can bring to life a homunculus, i.e., a man originating in the sperm (2.334) and then “begotten without the female body and the natural womb” (1.124). Small wonder that Victor believes he can achieve the power to “banish disease from the human frame” (p. 47), to “render man invul- nerable to any but a violent death,” even to generate life. Such powers are also important thematics in Cornelius Agrippa, early-sixteenth-century Cabalist, alchemist, physician, and experi- menter in breeding life from putrefying matter (Rowen 169). The vol- ume (p. 46) of Agrippa that Victor happens upon may have been the Occult Philosophy, for this book on the alchemical operations of what Agrippa calls “natural magic” offers several theories which would inter-JOHANNA M. SMITH 327 est Victor: that “the Passions of the Mind can work out of themselves upon another['s Body” (Agrippa 145) when “inflamed with a strong imagination”; that “the reviving of the dead” (58) may be accom- plished by “perfect men” (127) exercising “the powers of their soul”; and that such powers must be exercised in secret.” Agrippa warns that “[e]very Magical experiment fleeth the publike, seeks to be hid, is strengthened by silence, but is destroyed by publication” (349), so “it behoveth a Magicall operator, . . . to manifest to none, neither his work nor place, nor time.” But he also characterizes natural magic as the revealing of secrets: what seem the natural magician’s “incredible miracles” (qtd. in Henry 589) are often the work of nature, for natural magic simply “‘make[s] known the hidden and secret powers of nature.’” I am deliberately stressing the contradictory thematic of secrecy here, because it is this ambiguous paradigm of powers and secrets with which Victor begins his scientific education. Before turning to that education, however, I stress again that Victor's first preceptors, the alchemists, cannot simply be dismissed as nonscientists. The operations of natural magic were “‘derived from nature and in harmony with it’” (Agrippa, qtd. in Henry 589), and natural magicians were “‘careful explorers of nature[,] only directing what nature has formerly pre- pared’”; for this reason, natural magic was considered a “branch of sci- ence” (Kieckhefer 9). Thus the pertinent distinction is not between false science (alchemy or natural magic) and true science (chemistry) but between a discredited form of science and a newly dominant scien- tific paradigm. From childhood Victor has been as attracted as any alchemist to the secrets of nature; the world was “a secret which I desired to divine,” and repeatedly he tells us of his obsessive curiosity about “the hidden laws of nature” (p. 44), his “eager desire” to learn “the secrets of heaven and earth” (p. 45), his “fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature” (p. 47). At first Victor finds in the alchemists “men who had penetrated deeper and knew more” (p. 47), who promise a full revela- tion of nature’s powers and secrets. But then, to use Kuhn's terms, an anomaly occurs that cannot be explained by Victor’s current dominant *Albertus Magnus, another of Victor's alchemist mentors, is thought to have written a Book of Secrets, and his book On Alchemy warns against revealing its secrets (Kieck- hefer 142, 140). He was also interested in “artificial creation” (Rowen 169); he is vari- ously supposed to have constructed a brass housekeeper and a talking head (his pupil Thomas Aquinas is said to have destroyed the latter because of its distracting chat [Kieck- hefer 142]).}28 FEMINIST CRITICISM paradigm, viz., the great oak being “utterly destroyed” during a thun- derstorm. A “man of great research in natural philosophy” explains this phenomenon in terms of “electricity and galvanism,” and while this ex- planation satisﬁes Victor it also “overthrow[s]” the theories of his alchemists (p. 48). What ensues is, again in Kuhn’s terms, crisis: “It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known,” says Victor; “[a]ll that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despic- able.” His paradigm shift then begins, as he turns from the “would-be science” of the alchemists to the “secure” science of mathematics, and it continues with his studies in natural philosophy at the University of Ingolstadt. But Ingolstadt is an anomalous choice for a shift from alchemy to modern science. On the one hand, it was known for its preeminence in the modern experimental sciences: as early as 1675 its scientiﬁc appara- tus made it a “tourist attraction,” and in 1780 an Ingolstadt professor was recognized for his translation of a work on electricity (Heilbron 103, 143). On the other hand, Ingolstadt was also known as the home of the Illuminati, a secret society of freethinkers who operated by “direct communication with the holy spirit” (Vernon 274) rather than by “veriﬁable and repeatable” scientiﬁc experimentation. Victor’s expe- rience there is similarly anomalous: when he hears M. Waldman deliver a “panegyric upon modern chemistry” he converts to that science, but he simultaneously reverts to the visions of “boundless grandeur” he earlier associated with the alchemists (p. 52). Waldman’s panegyric is a virtual checklist of the achievements of modern chemists (Smith 49): “They ascend into the heavens” alludes to the scientiﬁc investigations conducted by balloonists; “they have discovered how the blood circu- lates, and the nature of the air we breathe” is a reference to Harvey and Lavoisier respectively; and “they can . . . mimic the earthquake” recalls the experiments of Priestley and others in producing with electricity the effects of earthquakes (p. 53). But when Victor, having heard all these wonders of modern chemistry, vows to “explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation” (p. 53), his emphasis on “powers” recalls Paracelsus, and his emphasis on revealing “deepest mysteries” recalls Agrippa’s view that natural magic reveals nature’s “hidden and secret powers.” In other words, the distinction between the alchemy phase and the chemistry phase of Victor’s educa- tion is “blurred” (Ketterer 61); the paradigm shift between the two is incomplete. As Victor’s education proceeds, again chemistry — his studies in the scientiﬁc community of Ingolstadt and his improvements of chemical instruments — leads back to alchemy: he retreats to a “soli-JOHANNA M. SMITH 329 tary chamber” (p. 58) as recommended by Agrippa. While his act of solitary creation might be seen as the apotheosis of masculine science dispensing with female reproduction, it might also be seen as the achieve- ment of the alchemists’ dream: discovering first “the cause of genera- tion and life” (pp. 56–57) and then the power of “bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.” And certainly chemistry and alchemy join when Victor animates the creature: using the scientific “instruments of life” (p. 60), he fulfills Paracelsus's promise of “driving away death.” Despite Victor’s conversion to modern chemistry, then, “significant traces of . . . the alchemist and natural magician remain” (Ketterer 64). We might say that Victor is still in crisis, and I would suggest that his crisis is a microcosm of the position of chemistry itself at the turn of the nineteenth century. Of course, the paradigm shift from alchemy to chemistry occurring at this time was sometimes smooth. When Wald- man locates the “foundations” (p. 54) of modern science in alchemy, for example, he is following one accepted line of thought; as late as 1834 the historian of science William Whewell still considered alchemy “the mother of Chemistry” (OED def. 1 of alchemy). Leading modern chemist Humphry Davy was called “‘the Father and Founder of philo- sophic alchemy’” (qtd. in Lawrence 222), and Waldman’s panegyric on modern chemistry often echoes the chemical/alchemical Davy (com- pare Waldman’s speech with Davy pp. 217–18). In a successful para- digm shift such as this, there is an “appropriation” (Henry 587) of the older paradigm’s “most naturalistic and rational aspects” into the newer one. But there is also a concurrent dismissal of less useful elements to, in Foucault's terms, subjugated knowledge – the popular, the inade- quate, the insufficiently “scientific.” The late-eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century crisis of chem- istry arose as elements of it were being thus disqualified. These were the elements tainted with the science of the electricians, and physiologists working in “medical electricity” were particularly suspect. Such men signified “‘a new medical Prometheanism, the belief that mechanical means could fix the malfunctioning body’” or even reanimate it (qtd. in Marshall 5). But because the boundary between life and death was still “widely held” to be “fluid” and “reversible,” such medical Prome- theuses might be seen not as healers but as “tormentors of the dead” *McWhir makes the intriguing argument that “Nature is parthenogenic, a female principle whose laws govern man’s being” (77), and hence that Victor is “simply a man who understands and employs a principle of nature.” "Or magical — one electrician complained that his lower-class audience was “‘so barbarously ignorant, that they have taken me for a Magician’” (qtd. in Heilbron 164). & 4330 FEMINIST CRITICISM (lordanova 66-67). Victor’s studies in anatomy and physiology (p. 56), not to mention his “instruments of life” (p. 60), thus link him to these discredited elements of chemistry. Furthermore, Mary’s introduction refers to the electrician Luigi Galvani, and his records of his electrical tests on frog parts are particularly pertinent to Frankenstein. Galvani’s interest in discovering “concealed properties” (23) recalls Victor’s in- terest in discovering nature’s secrets, and statements such as “my heart burned with desire” (40) recall the “ardour” (p. 58) with which Victor approaches his studies. Galvani’s experiments themselves seem to fore- shadow Victor’s, and the one in which, using the “customary [electri- cal] devices” (96), Galvani created movement in an amputated human arm and leg seems a prototype of Victor’s “dabbl[ing] among the unhallowed damps of the grave” (p. 58).“ If Victor is Promethean in these ways, it’s a short step to maintain that Shelley intends to critique “the aspiration of modern masculinist scientists to be technically creative divinities” (Hindle 23). As I have been suggesting, however, it is possible to read the novel rather as an exploration of the tensions called into being by such aspirations, specif- ically the tensions in the paradigm shift from alchemy to chemistry. One ﬁnal tension particularly pertinent to Frankenstein is the fact that early- nineteenth-century science operated in a separate-spheres structure. On the one hand, some experimental science took place in universities and other institutions; as Davy points out, however, men and women of all classes might conduct experiments on their own (p. 220). Crucially, many men who studied science worked “in a domestic rather than an institutional setting” (Iordanova 63), and many had the help of female relatives; Galvani’s wife often helped him with his electrical tests, and drawings of the electricians’ workspaces show that women featured in their experiments. The resultant tension for the scientist is very like the tension already explored in my “Cooped Up” section. The scientist who is “collaborat- ing with female relatives” (lordanova 64) yet trying to forge a “mascu- line professional identit[y]” is analogous to a Victor trying to negotiate between the feminized domestic sphere and the masculine sphere of science. Victor’s “workshop of ﬁlthy creation” (p. 58) is thus resonant in a number of ways that draw together the elements of my analysis. The workshop itself — not a domestic space but not quite an institu- tional setting — indicates Victor’s difﬁculties in escaping the domestic sphere so as to create a masculine professional identity. The solitude of “On such connections, Marshall’s book is invaluable.JOHANNA M. SMITH 331 the workshop indicates Victor’s return to an alchemical paradigm, but the product of the workshop is the return of that paradigm from its sta- tus as subjugated knowledge or “sad trash.” And if “ﬁlthy creation” in the workshop suggests the “attempt to exclude or repress the mater- nal” (Pike 155) which is characteristic of a separate-spheres culture, the monster also suggests the destructiveness consequent on such “coop- ing up.” Finally, as evidence of the crisis of early-nineteenth-century chemistry, Victor’s creation is also evidence of the gendering of the sciences, and thus it dramatizes how the separation of the spheres and the dualities of the sciences are equally Mary Shelley’s subject in Frankenstein.

Feminist criticism was accorded academic legitimacy in American universities “around 1981,” Iane Gallop claims in her book Around 1981: Academic Feminist Literary Theory. With Gallop’s title and amus- ing approximation in mind, Naomi Schor has since estimated that, “around 1985, feminism began to give way to what has come to be called gender studies” (Schor 275). In explaining her reason for saying that feminism began to give way to gender studies “around 1985,” Schor says that she chose that date “in part because it marks the publication of Between Men,” a book whose author, the inﬂuential gender critic Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, “articulates the insights of feminist criticism onto those of gay-male studies, which had up to then pursued often parallel but separate courses (afﬁrming the existence of a homosexual or female imagination, recov- ering lost traditions, decoding the cryptic discourse of works already in the canon by homosexual or feminist authors)” (Schor 276). Today, gay and lesbian criticism is so much a part of gender criticism that some people equate “sexualities criticism” with the gender approach. Many would quarrel with the notion that feminist criticism and women’s studies have been giving way to gender criticism and gender studies — and with the either/ or distinction that such a claim implies. 334WHAT IS GENDER CRITICISM? 335 Some would argue that feminist criticism is by deﬁnition gender criti- cism. (When Simone de Beauvoir declared in 1949 that “one is not born a woman, one becomes one” [301 ], she was talking about the way in which individuals of the female sex assume the feminine gender — that is, that elaborate set of restrictive, socially prescribed attitudes and behaviors that we associate with femininity.) Others would point out that one critic whose work everyone associates with feminism (Iulia Kris- teva) has problems with the feminist label, while another critic whose name, like Sedgwick’s, is continually linked with the gender approach (Teresa de Lauretis) continues to refer to herself and her work as feminist. Certainly, feminist and gender criticism are not polar opposites but, rather, exist along a continuum of attitudes toward sex and sexism, sex- uality and gender, language and the literary canon. There are, however, a few distinctions to be made between those critics whose writings are inevitably identiﬁed as being toward one end of the continuum or the other. One distinction is based on focus: as the word implies, “feminists” have concentrated their efforts on the study of women and women’s issues. Gender criticism, by contrast, has not been woman centered. It has tended to view the male and female sexes — and the masculine and feminine genders — in terms ofa complicated continuum, much as we are viewing feminist and gender criticism. Critics like Diane K. Lewis have raised the possibility that black women may be more like white men in terms of familial and economic roles, like black men in terms of their relationships with whites, and like white women in terms of their relationships with men. Lesbian gender critics have asked whether les- bian women are really more like straight women than they are like gay (or for that matter straight) men. That we refer to gay and lesbian stud- ies as gender studies has led some to suggest that gender studies is a misnomer; after all, homosexuality is not a gender. This objection may easily be answered once we realize that one purpose of gender criticism is to criticize gender as we commonly conceive of it, to expose its insuf- ﬁciency and inadequacy as a category. Another distinction between feminist and gender criticism is based on the terms “gender” and “sex.” As de Lauretis suggests in Technolo- gies of Gender (1987), feminists of the 1970s tended to equate gender with sex, gender difference with sexual difference. But that equation doesn’t help us explain “the differences among women, . . . the differ- ences within women.” After positing that “we need a notion of gender that is not so bound up with sexual difference,” de Lauretis provides336 GENDER CRITICISM just such a notion by arguing that “gender is not a property of bodies or something originally existent in human beings”; rather, it is “the prod- uct of various social technologies, such as cinema” (2). Gender is, in other words, a construct, an effect of language, culture, and its institu- tions. It is gender, not sex, that causes a weak old man to open a door for an athletic young woman. And it is gender, not sex, that may cause one young woman to expect old men to behave in this way, another to view this kind of behavior as chauvinistic and insulting, and still another to have mixed feelings (hence de Lauretis’s phrase “differences within women”) about “gentlemanly gallantry.” Still another, related distinction between feminist and gender criti- cism is based on the essentialist views of many feminist critics and the constructionist views of many gender critics (both those who would call themselves feminists and those who would not). Stated simply and per- haps too reductively, the term “essentialist” refers to the view that women are essentially different from men. “Constructionist,” by con- trast, refers to the view that most of those differences are characteristics not of the male and female sex (nature) but, rather, of the masculine and feminine genders (nurture). Because of its essentialist tendencies, “radical feminism,” according to Sedgwick, “tends to deny that the meaning of gender or sexuality has ever signiﬁcantly changed; and more damagingly, it can make future change appear impossible” (Between Men 13). Most obviously essentialist would be those feminists who empha- size the female body, its difference, and the manifold implications of that difference. The equation made by some avant-garde French femi- nists between the female body and the maternal body has proved espe- cially troubling to some gender critics, who worry that it may paradoxically play into the hands of extreme conservatives and funda- mentalists seeking to reestablish patriarchal family values. In her book The Reproduction of Mothering (1978), Nancy Chodorow, a sociologist of gender, admits that what we call “mothering”— not having or nurs- ing babies but mothering more broadly conceived — is commonly associated not just with the feminine gender but also with the female sex, often considered nurturing by nature. But she critically interro- gates the common assumption that it is in women’s nature or biological destiny to “mother” in this broader sense, arguing that the separation of home and workplace brought about by the development of capital- ism and the ensuing industrial revolution made mothering appear to be essentially a woman’s job in modern Western society.WHAT IS GENDER CRITICISM? 337 If sex turns out to be gender where mothering is concerned, what differences are grounded in sex — that is, nature? Are there essential differences between men and women — other than those that are purely anatomical and anatomically determined (for example, a man can exclusively take on the job of feeding an infant milk, but he may not do so from his own breast)? A growing number of gender critics would answer the question in the negative. Sometimes referred to as “extreme constructionists” and “postfeminists,” these critics have adopted the viewpoint of philosopher Iudith Butler, who in her book Gender Trouble (1990) predicts that “sex, by deﬁnition, will be shown to have been gender all along” (8). As Naomi Schor explains their position, “there is nothing outside or before culture, no nature that is not always and already enculturated” (278). Whereas a number of feminists celebrate women’s difference, post- feminist gender critics would agree with Chodorow’s statement that men have an “investment in difference that women do not have” (Eisenstein and Iardine 14). They see difference as a symptom of oppression, not a cause for celebration, and would abolish it by disman- tling gender categories and, ultimately, destroying gender itself. Because gender categories and distinctions are embedded in and per- petuated through language, gender critics like Monique Wittig have called for the wholesale transformation of language into a nonsexist, and nonheterosexist, medium. Language has proved the site of important debates between femi- nist and gender critics, essentialists and constructionists. Gender critics have taken issue with those French feminists who have spoken of a fem- inine language and writing and who have grounded differences in lan- guage and writing in the female body.‘ For much the same reason, they have disagreed with those French-inﬂuenced Anglo-American critics who, like Toril Moi and Nancy K. Miller, have posited an essential rela- tionship between sexuality and textuality. (In an essentialist sense, such critics have suggested that when women write, they tend to break the rules of plausibility and verisimilitude that men have created to evaluate ﬁction.) Gender critics like Peggy Kamuf posit a relationship only ‘Because feminist/ gender studies, not unlike sex/gender, should be thought of as existing along a continuum of attitudes and not in terms of simple opposition, attempts to highlight the difference between feminist and gender criticism are inevitably prone to reductive overgeneralization and occasional distortion. Here, for instance, French femi- nism is made out to be more monolithic than it actually is. Hélene Cixous has said that a few men (such as Iean Genet) have produced “feminine writing,” although she suggests that these are exceptional men who have acknowledged their own bisexuality. ll338 GENDER CRITICISM between gender and textuality, between what most men and women become after they are born and the way in which they write. They are therefore less interested in the author’s sexual “signature”— in whether the author was a woman writing — than in whether the author was (to borrow from Kamuf) “Writing like a Woman.” Feminists such as Miller have suggested that no man could write the “female anger, desire, and selfhood” that Emily Bronte, for instance, inscribed in her poetry and in Wuthering Heights (Subject 72). In the view of gender critics, it is and has been possible for a man to write like a woman, a woman to write like a man. Shari Benstock, a noted feminist critic whose investigations into psychoanalytic and poststructuralist theory have led her increasingly to adopt the gender approach, poses the following question to herself in Textualizing the Feminine (1991): “Isn’t it precisely ‘the feminine’ in Ioyce’s writings and Derrida’s that carries me along?” (45). In an essay entitled “Unsexing Language: Pro- nomial Protest in Emily Dickinson’s ‘Lay This Laurel,’ ” Anna Shannon Elfenbein has argued that “like Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson crossed the gender barrier in some remarkable poems,” such as “We learned to like the Fire / By playing Glaciers — when a Boy —” (215). It is also possible, in the view of most gender critics, for women to read as men, men as women. The view that women can, and indeed have been forced to, read as men has been fairly noncontroversial. Everyone agrees that the literary canon is largely “androcentric” and that writings by men have tended to “immasculate” women, forcing them to see the world from a masculine viewpoint. But the question of whether men can read as women has proved to be yet another issue dividing feminist and gender critics. Some feminists suggest that men and women have some essentially different reading strategies and out- comes, while gender critics maintain that such differences arise entirely out of social training and cultural norms. One interesting outcome of recent attention to gender and reading is Elizabeth A. Flynn’s argu- ment that women in fact make the best interpreters of imaginative liter- ature. Based on a study of how male and female students read works of ﬁction, she concludes that women come up with more imaginative, open-ended readings of stories. Quite possibly the imputed hedging and tentativeness of women’s speech, often seen by men as disadvan- tages, are transformed into useful interpretive strategies — receptivity combined with critical assessment of the text — in the act of reading (Flynn and Schweickart 286). In singling out a catalyst of gender studies, many historians of criti- cism have pointed to Michel Foucault. In his History of SexualityWHAT IS GENDER CRITICISM? 339 (1976, trans. 1978), Foucault distinguished sexuality from sex, calling the former a “technology of sex.” De Lauretis, who has deliberately developed her theory of gender “along the lines of . . . Foucault’s the- ory of sexuality,” explains his use of “technology” this way: “sexuality, commonly thought to be a natural as well as a private matter, is in fact completely constructed in culture according to the political aims of the society’s dominant class” (Technologies 2, 12). Foucault suggests that homosexuality as we now think of it was to a great extent an invention of the nineteenth century. In earlier periods there had been “acts of sodomy” and individuals who committed them, but the “sodomite” was, according to Foucault, “a temporary aberra- tion,” not the “species” he became with the advent of the modern con- cept of homosexuality (42-43). According to Foucault, in other words, sodomitic acts did not deﬁne people so markedly as the word homosex- ual tags and marks people now. Sodomitic acts have been replaced by homosexual persons, and in the process the range of acceptable relation- ships between individuals of the same gender has been restrictively altered. As Sedgwick writes, “to specify some0ne’s sexuality [today] is not to locate her or him on a map teeming with zoophiles, gyneco- masts, sexoesthetic inverts, and so forth. . . . In the late twentieth cen- tury, if I ask you what your sexual orientation or sexual preference is, you will understand me to be asking precisely one thing: whether you are homosexual or heterosexual” (“Gender” 282). By historicizing sexuality, Foucault made it possible for his succes- sors to consider the possibility that all of the categories and assumptions that currently come to mind when we think about sex, sexual differ- ence, gender, and sexuality are social artifacts, the products of cultural discourses. Following Foucault’s lead, some gay and lesbian critics have argued that the heterosexual/ homosexual distinction is as much a cul- tural construct as is the masculine / feminine dichotomy. Arguing that sexuality is a continuum, not a ﬁxed and static set of binary oppositions, a number of gay and lesbian critics have critiqued heterosexuality arguing that it has been an enforced corollary and con- sequence of what Gayle Rubin has referred to as the “sex/ gender sys- tem” (“Trafﬁc”). According to this system, persons of the male sex are assumed to be masculine, masculine men are assumed to be attracted to women, and therefore it is supposedly natural for men to be attracted to women and unnatural for them to be attracted to men. Lesbian critics have also taken issue with some feminists on the grounds that they pro- ceed from fundamentally heterosexual and even heterosexist assump- tions. Particularly offensive to lesbians have been those feminists who,340 GENDER CRITICISM following Doris Lessing, have implied that to afﬁrm a lesbian identity is to act out feminist hostility against men. According to poet-critic Adrienne Rich, The fact is that women in every culture throughout history have undertaken the task of independent, nonheterosexual, women- centered existence, to the extent made possible by their context, often in the belief that they were the “only ones” ever to have done so. They have undertaken it even though few women have been in an economic position to resist marriage altogether; and even though attacks against [them] have ranged from aspersions and mockery to deliberate gynocide. (141) Rich goes on to suggest, in her essay entitled “Compulsory Heterosex- uality and Lesbian Existence,” that “heterosexuality [is] a beachhead of male dominance,” and that, “like motherhood, [it] needs to be recog- nized and studied as a political institution” (143, 145). If there is such a thing as reading like a woman and such a thing as reading like a man, how then do lesbians read? Are there gay and les- bian ways of reading? Many would say that there are. Rich, by reading Emily Dickinson’s poetry as a lesbian — by not assuming that “hetero- sexual romance is the key to a woman’s life and wor ”— has intro- duced us to a poet somewhat different from the one heterosexual critics have made familiar (Lies 158). As for gay reading, Wayne Koestenbaum has deﬁned “the (male twentieth-century ﬁrst world) gay reader” as one who “reads resistantly for inscriptions of his condition, for texts that will conﬁrm a social and private identity founded on a desire for other men. . . . Reading becomes a hunt for histories that deliberately foreknow or unwittingly trace a desire felt not by author but by reader, who is most acute when searching for signs of himself” (176-77). Lesbian critics have produced a number of compelling reinter- pretations, or in-scriptions, of works by authors as diverse as Emily Dickinson, Virginia Woolf, and Toni Morrison. As a result of these provocative readings, signiﬁcant disagreements have arisen between straight and lesbian critics and among lesbian critics as well. Perhaps the most famous and interesting example of this kind of interpretive con- troversy involves the claim by Barbara Smith and Adrienne Rich that Morrison’s novel Sula can be read as a lesbian text — and author Toni Morrison’s counterclaim that it cannot. Gay male critics have produced a body of readings no less revisionist and controversial, focusing on writers as staidly classic as Henry Iames and Wallace Stevens. In Melville’s Billy Budd and Moby-Dick, Robert K.WHAT IS GENDER CRITICISM? 341 Martin suggests, a triangle of homosexual desire exists. In the latter novel, the hero must choose between a captain who represents “the imposition of the male on the female” and a “Dark Stranger” (Quee- queg) who “offers the possibility of an alternate sexuality, one that is less dependent upon performance and conquest” (5). Masculinity as a complex construct producing and reproducing a constellation of behaviors and goals, many of them destructive (like performance and conquest) and most of them injurious to women, has become the object of an unprecedented number of gender studies. A 1983 issue of Feminist Review contained an essay entitled “Anti-Porn: Soft Issue, Hard World,” in which B. Ruby Rich suggested that the “legions of feminist men” who examine and deplore the effects of pornography on women might better “undertake the analysis that can tell us why men like porn (not, piously, why this or that exceptional man does not)” (Clark 185). The advent of gender criticism makes pre- cisely that kind of analysis possible. Stephen H. Clark, who alludes to Ruby Rich’s challenge, reads T. S. Eliot “as a man.” Responding to “Eliot’s implicit appeal to a speciﬁcally masculine audience — ‘You! hypocrite lecteur! — mon semblable, — mon frere!’ ”— Clark con- cludes that poems such as “Sweeney among the Nightingales” and “Gerontion,” rather than offering what they are usually said to offer — “a social critique into which a misogynistic language accidentally seeps”— instead articulate a masculine “psychology of sexual fear and desired retaliation” (Clark 173). Some gender critics focusing on masculinity have analyzed “the anthropology of boyhood,” a phrase coined by Mark Seltzer in an ar- ticle in which he comparatively reads, among other things, Stephen Crane’s Red Badge of Courage, Iack London’s White Fang, and the ﬁrst Boy Scouts of America handbook (150). Others have examined the fear men have that artistry is unmasculine, a guilty worry that surfaces per- haps most obviously in “The Custom-House,” Hawthorne’s lengthy preface to The Scarlet Letter. Still others have studied the representation in literature of subtly erotic disciple-patron relationships, relationships like the ones between Nick Carraway and Iay Gatsby, Charlie Marlow and Lord Iim, Doctor Watson and Sherlock Holmes, and any number of characters in Henry Iames’s stories. Not all of these studies have focused on literary texts. Because the movies have played a primary role in gender construction during our lifetimes, gender critics have ana- lyzed the dynamics of masculinity (vis-a-vis femininity and androgyny) in ﬁlms from Rebel without a Cause to Tootsie to last year’s Best Picture. One of the “social technologies” most inﬂuential in (re)constructing342 GENDER CRITICISM gender, film is one of the media in which today’s sexual politics is most evident. Necessary as it is, in an introduction such as this one, to define the difference between feminist and gender criticism, it is equally necessary to conclude by unmaking the distinction, at least partially. The two top- ics just discussed (film theory and so-called queer theory) give us grounds for undertaking that necessary deconstruction. The alliance I have been creating between gay and lesbian criticism on the one hand and gender criticism on the other is complicated greatly by the fact that not all gay and lesbian critics are constructionists. Indeed, a number of them (Robert K. Martin included) share with many feminists the essen- tialist point of view; that is, they believe homosexuals and heterosexuals to be essentially different, different by nature, just as a number of femi- nists believe men and women to be different. In film theory and criticism, feminist and gender critics have so influenced one another that their differences would be difficult to define based on any available criteria, including the ones just outlined. Cinema has been of special interest to contemporary feminists like Trinh T. Minh-ha (herself a filmmaker) and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (whose critical eye has focused on movies including My Beautiful Laundrette and Sammie and Rosie Get Laid). Teresa de Lauretis, whose Technologies of Gender (1987) has proved influential in the area of gender studies, continues to publish film criticism consistent with ear- lier, unambiguously feminist works in which she argued that “the repre- sentation of woman as spectacle — body to be looked at, place of sexuality, and object of desire – so pervasive in our culture, finds in narrative cinema its most complex expression and widest circulation” (Alice 4). Feminist film theory has developed alongside a feminist perfor- mance theory grounded in Joan Riviere's recently rediscovered essay “Womanliness as a Masquerade” (1929), in which the author argues that there is no femininity that is not masquerade. Marjorie Garber, a contemporary cultural critic with an interest in gender, has analyzed the constructed nature of femininity by focusing on men who have appar- ently achieved it – through the transvestism, transsexualism, and other forms of “cross-dressing” evident in cultural productions from Shake- speare to Elvis, from “Little Red Riding Hood” to La Cage aux Folles. The future of feminist and gender criticism, it would seem, is not one of further bifurcation but one involving a refocusing on femininity, °ulinity, and related sexualities, not only as represented in poems,WHAT IS GENDER CRITICISM? 343 novels, and films but also as manifested and developed in video, on tele- vision, and along the almost infinite number of waystations rapidly being developed on the information highways running through an exponentially expanding cyberspace. In the essay that follows, “Lesbian Panic and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,” Frann Michel surveys various definitions of “lesbian fic- tion.” According to some of her fellow gender critics, fiction is “les- bian” if it critiques heterosexual institutions (such as marriage and family) and contains strong female characters who relate to and identify with one another in positive ways. In defining lesbian this broadly, crit- ics follow the lead of Adrienne Rich, who has mapped all supportive bonds between women on a “‘lesbian continuum of which specifically sexual lesbian existence’ is only one pole” (p. 354 in this volume). Michel continually interrogates such inclusive and general defini- tions of lesbianism and lesbian fiction. She argues that “relations of sameness or identification between women do not necessarily consti- tute specifically lesbian relations” and agrees with Teresa de Lauretis that the tendency to reduce lesbian sexuality to sisterhood and female friendship “implies that women’s sexual relations with each other are somehow less important, less powerful, less conflicted” than those other bonds (p. 350). “Though desire and identification are intimately related, they are not identical” (p. 350), Michel goes on to argue, and it is “desire,” not “identification,” that characterizes lesbian relations — and lesbian fiction. Indeed, “a number of late-eighteenth- and early- nineteenth-century texts suggest a discourse in which sexual desire is signified not only by the primacy of bonds between women, but also by socially resonant differences between women”— differences involving such things as “race, class, [and] gender style” (p. 350). Conceding that “Frankenstein seems . . . an unlikely book to dis- cuss in terms of erotic relations between women, since it is so much a novel about men” (p. 350), and also admitting that some of the best recent readings of the novel see it either as a feminist text “primarily concerned with. . . . maternal anxiety” (p. 355) or as a specifically gay — not lesbian — fiction, Michel stops short of declaring Franken- stein a lesbian text. She does, nonetheless, go on to make the case that “representations of identification between women” in Mary Shelley’s novel “almost . . . slide over into representations of desire between women,” and that the creature “can be read as the embodiment of les- bian panic,” i.e., the “phobic reaction to sexual desire between women, characteristically represented through the reaction of a third person,344 GENDER CRITICISM whose triangulating gaze disrupts the bond between two women, and renders visible the differences between them” (p. 351). Michel subsequently provides two examples of lesbian panic, or “horror at sapphic sexuality” (p. 351). One is a scene in Mary, a novel by Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Shelley’s mother. The other involves the panic experienced by Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley’s husband, “[a] few days after the beginning of the ghost story competition in which Frankenstein originated” (p. 35 1). (This incident occurred as Percy was looking at his wife and listening to Lord Byron read Coleridge’s “Christabel,” a poem with strong lesbian overtones.) In providing these examples, Michel sets out to establish that “a discourse of sapphic monstrosity” was “part of the cultural context in which the novel was produced” (p. 353). Like many if not most gender critics, Michel pays homage to the feminist approach even as she signals her points of departure from it. She informatively surveys feminist readings of Frankenstein as a “birth myth” (p. 355) in which a man brings into the world a destructive crea- ture while all the female mothers and maternal ﬁgures die — a story that itself may be viewed as its author’s “hideous progeny” (p. 25). Of particular interest to Michel are Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar’s reading of the repellently embodied creature as a representation of Eve and, more generally, of women, and Margaret Homans’s parallel argu- ment that “ ‘the impossibility of Frankenstein giving [the creature] a female demon, an object of its own desire, aligns the demon with women, who are forbidden to have their own desires’ ” (p. 357). But for Michel, these “straight” feminist readings have in some ways “repeated the novel’s evasions” of lesbian sexuality by assuming “a con- tinuum of relationships between women without a point of division between erotic and nonerotic relations” (p. 356). Michel’s admission that the novel itself avoids or evades the subject of lesbian desire may at ﬁrst seem perplexing — almost like an admis- sion that, in going beyond feminist analysis, she has also gone beyond Frankenstein, i.e., made an argument that cannot be textually sup- ported. But, in fact, by identifying these moments of evasion and show- ing how they work within the novel’s discourse, Michel ultimately makes her case more powerful and credible. (Who, after all, would expect a heterosexual woman author living in a heterosexual, heterosex- ist world to produce a lesbian text that actually foregrounded physical desire between women?) One of those moments of evasion occurs when Elizabeth tells her servant, Iustine, “I wish . . . I were to die with you” (p. 85) and Iustine responds with “considerably more impas-A SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY 34$ sioned statements” (p. 359) just before being executed as a convicted murderer whose main crime, in Michel’s view, “seems to be her raising the possibility of a relation between women that is not constituted by identiﬁcation” (p. 361). In advancing her argument, Michel makes many fascinating points about such things as “[w]omen’s inequality,” “the neglect of women,” and “the shape of male homophobia in Shelley’s day” (p. 362). To summarize them all would be to spoil the fun of watching her argument unfold. Sufﬁce it to say here that “Lesbian Panic and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein” is a wonderful example of gay and lesbian criticism as well as of gender criticism more generally, insofar as it establishes its dif- ference from feminist criticism, focuses on issues of sexuality as well as gender, and illustrates how issues pertaining to homosexuality can be found in and pertinent to texts by heterosexuals — not as issues addressed positively and forthrightly, necessarily, but rather as ones made visible through textual avoidance, elision, and evasion.

A GENDER PERSPECTIVE FRANN MICHEL Lesbian Panic and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein When is a lesbian fiction not a lesbian fiction? Fairly often, one might gather from the variety of approaches to defining the territory of a lesbian criticism: much depends on who is reading, and how. On the one hand, there is the failure — sometimes the refusal – of straight readings to recognize lesbian elements of a text. On the other, there are the efforts to construct lesbian readings of apparently straight texts by seeking subtextual and coded representations. Thus Barbara Smith has suggested that a lesbian novel is one that takes a “critical stance toward the heterosexual institutions of male/female relationships, marriage and the family.” Additionally, Smith sees as essential to the lesbian novel women’s being “central figures . . . positively portrayed and hav[ing] pivotal relationships with one another” (9). Building on this analysis, Marilyn Farwell has argued that “lesbian narrative space” is “a disrup- tive space of sameness” because “only in the space of sameness can [les- bian] desire emerge” (93, 97). Yet relations of sameness or identification between women do not necessarily constitute specifically lesbian relations. Teresa de Lauretis comments that “the sweeping of lesbian sexuality and desire under the rug of sisterhood, female friendship, and the now popular theme of the350 GENDER CRITICISM ‘mother-daughter bond’” implies that women’s sexual relations with each other are somehow less important, less powerful, less conflicted than those other bonds (258). “In all three parts of the rug,” de Lau- retis observes, “what is in question is not desire but identification,” where “desire” is defined as a sexual “wanting to have (the object)” and “identification” as a desexualized “wanting to be or to be like or seeing oneself as (the object)” (258, 260). Though desire and identification are intimately related, they are not identical. Thus while Smith’s defini- tion of the lesbian novel is useful for raising the questions of desire between women, it also replicates the elision of the specificity of that desire in cultural discourse. Furthermore, it cannot apprehend women’s phobic responses to such desire. Indeed, that phobic reaction to sexual desire between women delineates the erotic as an arena significantly distinct from the more simply affective. The precise exemplification of the erotic is, of course, historically and culturally variable, and not necessarily coherent. But a number of late-eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century texts suggest a discourse in which sexual desire is signified not only by the primacy of bonds between women, but also by socially resonant differences be- tween women (of race, class, gender style)." The possibility of reading Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein in relation to such a discourse, however, has been occluded by readers’ tendency to subsume erotic relations between women under the rubric of identification, and thus to avoid the possibility of discovering in the novel a lesbian subtext. Admittedly, Frankenstein seems at first sight an unlikely book to discuss in terms of erotic relations between women, since it is so much a novel about men. But the novel’s complexity reveals multiple influ- ences, and leaves it open to multiple readings. Frankenstein's monster has been read as the embodiment of scientific hubris, of the enraged working class, of maternal and neonatal monstrosity, and of male homosexual panic.” In particular, among the most persuasive readings have been those straight (and largely psychoanalytic) feminist studies of the novel in terms of the monstrous maternity of female authorship, together with gay male-oriented studies that see it as an example of the paranoid Gothic. Visible between these (sometimes mutually repellent) "Terry Castle has made a congruent argument about the structural importance of homosocial bonds between women in twentieth-century lesbian fiction. *For descriptions and examples of readings of the novel through scientific issues, Marxist criticism, and hetero-maternalist feminist criticism, see the essays in Levine and Knoepflmacher. On male homosexual panic, see Sedgwick, Between 91, 115, 151.FRANN MICHEL 351 readings are moments in the novel at which representations of identiﬁ- cation between women almost, but not quite, slide over into represen- tations of desire between women; visible, too, is the penumbra of moments surrounding the novel in which legibly sapphic engagements elicit varying degrees of horror, dismay, and embarrassment. In context of the cultural discourse of sapphic monstrosity contemporary to the novel, Frankenstein’s creature can also be read as the embodiment of this lesbian panic. The proscription of nonidentiﬁcatory bonds between women in the novel can best be understood in the wider context of cul- tural representations of horror associated with the late-eighteenth- and early-nineteenth century’s newly constructed role of the sapphist. SAPPHIC MONSTROSITY Beginning in the eighteenth century in Britain, women who pur- sued and engaged in sexual relations with other women came to be known as sapphists. Unlike women who had erotic relations with other women in earlier periods, they were no longer seen as hermaphrodites (having a different gender than women), nor as engaging in a sin to which any woman might succumb through libertinism. Instead, sap- phists occupied a new social role, as a minority “whose minds had been corrupted from the normal desires of their female bodies” (Trumbach 121). In this essay, I use the term “sapphist” to call attention to the understanding of women’s same-sex eroticism current in Shelley’s day. But I also use the term “lesbian” to suggest the historical continuities (real or retrospective) of women’s erotic relations with each other. By “lesbian panic” I mean a phobic reaction to sexual desire between women, characteristically represented through the reaction of a third person, whose triangulating gaze disrupts the bond between two women, and renders visible the differences between them. At least one possible example of horror at sapphic sexuality was known to Mary Shelley. A few days after the beginning of the ghost story contest in which Frankenstein originated, Byron was reciting some lines from Coleridge’s “Christabel” about Geraldine, who is, like the demon, a composite body, half young and beautiful, and half (in the version Byron recited) “hideous, deformed, and pale of hue.” Percy, “suddenly shrieking and putting his hands to his head, ran out of the room with a candle.” Brought to his senses, he told Byron and Polidori that352 GENDER CRITICISM “he was looking at Mrs. Shelley” while Byron was repeating Coleridge's lines, “and suddenly thought of a woman he had heard of who had eyes instead of nipples.” (Homans 109, quoting Polidori's diary) Like the complex structure of indirection that presents Frankenstein's monster to us (through Walton’s narrative of Victor’s narrative of the creature’s narrative of others’ responses to his hideousness), this moment encodes a network of sexual and affectional terrors and bonds — a network merely indexed by Percy Shelley’s notable presence of mind in grabbing his candle before fleeing. More specifically, of course, “Christabel” has been widely read as representing lesbian sexu- ality.” Christabel finds the mysterious Geraldine in a wood and takes her home to bed; there Geraldine, holding Christabel in her arms, works “harms” and has her “will” (ll. 298, 306). Christabel wakes the next morning, sees Geraldine’s “heaving breasts,” and thinks, “‘Sure I have sinn’d!’” (380,381). Later in the poem, a dream images their relation- ship as that of a snake coiled about a dove, and Christabel, for a moment, sees Geraldine as having “shrunken serpent eyes” (602). Percy’s vision of the repulsive embodiment of a collection of mis- matched body parts thus seems inspired by a figure of sapphic agency: “Mrs. Shelley” appears monstrous by her association with Geraldine the satanic sapphist. Percy’s visionary leap from sapphic monstrosity to Mary-as- monster seems propelled by the monstrous maternal agency of the breasts-with-eyes. Monstrous maternity is, clearly, one way of under- standing Victor’s animation of the repulsive body composed of col- lected body parts. But the route from sapphic monstrosity to Mary’s monstrosity may lie by way of horror not just at maternal sexuality in general, but at the sexuality of Mary’s mother in particular. The use of the serpent as an image for Geraldine resonates against the use that Mary's father, William Godwin, made of the rejuvenating serpent as an "Faderman suggests that contemporaries probably thought the poem was obscene not because it represented sex between women but because Geraldine was thought to be a man in disguise. But the figure of the sapphist or “tommy” was familiar by the late eigh- teenth century (Trumbach 129), and Faderman acknowledges that the poem may indeed have been understood as being about the evils of lesbian sex (277,463). Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar mention “Christabel” as a possible influence on the novel, but focus on Geraldine's anxiety about Christabel's dead mother, they do not suggest that the absence of the mother may enable sexual connection between the women (245)FRANN MICHEL 353 image for Mary Wollstonecraft, her mother (Todd xx). Moreover, while Godwin saw Wollstonecraft’s friend Fanny Blood as no worse than unworthy of his wife, and Wollstonecraft later saw the ﬁiendship nostal- gically, her early writings suggest that the relationship with Blood may once have been erotically problematic. Both Shelleys were familiar with Wollstonecraft’s works, including the somewhat autobiographical early novel, Mary. The protagonist of that eponymous text “loved Ann better than anyone in the world . . . To have this friend constantly with her . . . would it not be superlative bliss?” (15). So far, so sentimental. But when the two women go abroad together, Ann falls ill, and Mary tells her fellow lodgers, “I cannot live without her! — I have no other friend; if I lose her, what a desart [sic] will the world be to me.” “No other fiend,” re-echoed they, “have you not a husband?” Mary shrunk back, and was alternately pale and red. A delicate sense of propriety pre- vented her replying; and recalled her bewildered reason. (23) As with Percy’s monstrous vision, the impropriety of the character Mary’s position is available to her only through the responses of others. Embarrassment effects a physical withdrawal, a shrinking back, and the passion of Wollstonecraft’s heroine for another woman is framed as unspeakable and unreasonable. Neither Coleridge’s poem nor Percy’s vision need reﬂect Mary Shelley’s view, of course. But both poem and vision help constitute a discourse of sapphic monstrosity as part of the cultural context in which the novel was produced. If “Christabel” provides a context for Frankenstein, however, it is one that is visible only obliquely, through the gaps and silences in the novel, evaded not just by Percy but also by Frankenstein’s text itself. Geraldine does not seem to be simply half- beautiful, half-hideous, like Milton’s Sin or Spenser’s Errour. Rather, Christabel has moments of “vision” in which she sees “that bosom old . . . that bosom cold” (453, 457-58) or in which Geraldine’s “look askance” reveals “those shrunken serpent eyes” (608, 602). Geraldine’s hideousness, in other words, appears to be revealed only by an optical shift, a difference in view. Bringing into view the horror of sapphic agency that constitutes a background to Frankenstein, visible only from an oblique angle, reenacts the optical shift necessary to perceive even the (foreclosed) possibility of erotic relations between the novel’s women.3$4 GENDER CRITICISM READING MOTHERS AND LOVERS In designating this erotic desire between women as “lesbian,” of course, I risk anachronism and imprecision. Adrienne Rich has placed all women’s supportive bonds with each other — including friendship, sisterhood, and mother-daughter relations — on a “lesbian contin- uum,” of which speciﬁcally sexual “lesbian existence” is only one pole. But others have stressed that such usage not only implies an unbroken continuity between affective and erotic relations, but also obscures the different experiences of women-loving-women in other times and places. Historians of sexuality have suggested that not only the terms by which we designate sexualities, but also the concepts those terms repre- sent — the concepts through which we understand and experience sex- uality — have changed across time and cultures. Thus the boundaries of lesbian history are as vexed as the boundaries of the lesbian novel: though there have always been women who loved other women, they have not always identiﬁed as lesbian. Taking a more historical approach than Rich, Lillian Faderman ﬁnds precursors to modern lesbian rela- tionships in women’s “romantic friendships,” passionate relations that were not necessarily genitally sexual, and not stigmatized until the late nineteenth century. The work of Rich and Faderman offers a useful counterweight to popular misconceptions about lesbians. It emphasizes that modern lesbian identity is about more than just genital sexuality, and it challenges the model promoted by late-nineteenth-century sex- ologists, who viewed women-who-love-women as mannish, or even as men trapped in women’s bodies. But in accentuating affective bonds, both the “lesbian continuum” and the notion of “romantic friendship” may neglect what is speciﬁc to women’s erotic bonds. My point here is not that a lesbian subtext is “really there” or that Frankenstein is a “lesbian novel.” It is, rather, the converse: the absence of erotic bonds between women is constitutive both of Mary Shelley’s text and of straight feminist readings of the novel. Such bonds are, in other words, marginalized by the homophobic and heterosexist para- digms both critiqued and constructed by the novel and by the critical perspectives that replicate or exacerbate those patterns. Many such readings have interpreted the creature as coded female, and in doing so have elided male homosocial relations in the novel, or even reinscribed homophobic paradigms. Reading the novel as a critique of male homo- sexual panic, however, helps reveal the ways in which that critique depends on the absence of erotic relations between women. Thus both Frankenstein and straight feminist readings of the novel emphasize rela-FRANN MICHEL 355 tions of identiﬁcation between women, while proscribing relations of desire between women. Moreover, critics enforce this proscription by construing desire between women in terms of identiﬁcation, while ignoring differences that might open a space for erotic desire. Most of the now-canonical feminist studies of the novel have pur- sued arguments primarily concerned with maternity, often seeing Vic- tor as “usurping the female” (Mellor 115).4 Ever since Ellen Moers’s study of Frankenstein as a birth myth, for instance, the novel has been persuasively read as a text of maternal anxiety (79). Frankenstein was written in the midst of a series of well-known maternal horrors in Shel- ley’s life — her mother had died from a postpartum hemorrhage after giving birth to her, two of her own daughters died in infancy, her son William died at age three and a half, and during the writing of Franken- stein Mary’s half-sister Fanny Imlay killed herself on discovering she was illegitimate; further, Percy’s ﬁrst wife Harriet committed suicide while pregnant by another man. Those biographical circumstances are, according to these readings, reﬂected in the text itself: Frankenstein is a story about a man giving birth to a creature that destroys his life and family, a story in which all the mothers and maternal ﬁgures die or have died, a story that is itself the author’s “hideous progeny” (p. 25). In addition to seeing Victor as a kind of male mother, a number of readers have also seen the (male) creature as a representation of female- ness or femininity.5 Particularly since Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar’s reading of Frankenstein, in which they see the novel as a rewriting of Paradise Lost, feminist critics have tended to interpret the creature as both female and maternal. Nameless, homeless, repellently embodied, the creature further shares with Milton’s Eve a watery self-recognition and a capacity for bringing death into the human world (see Gilbert and Gubar 241-42, 247). The doubling of Victor and his creature becomes an analogue for the relations of mirroring or doubling between women in the novel — mother-daughter or surrogate mother- daughter relations between Caroline and Elizabeth, Caroline and Ius- tine Moritz, Madame Moritz and Iustine, Saﬁe and her mother; and relations of surrogate sisterhood between Agatha and Saﬁe and be- tween Elizabeth and Iustine. Both Victor and the creature have been seen as ﬁguratively women, but the relation of desire between them has ‘These accounts, written in the late 1970s and early 1980s, have acquired a canonical status through their continuing presentation to undergraduate readers in volumes such as that edited by Levine and Knoepﬂmacher. 5Among those who have seen the creature as ﬁguratively female are Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, Barbara Iohnson, Anne Mellor, Mary Poovey, and Margaret Homans.356 GENDER CRITICISM been discussed in terms of heteroeroticism or of male homoeroticism, never in terms of female homoeroticism. Margaret Homans’s syncretic psychoanalytic feminist reading of Frankenstein is exemplary of this line of study. Homans delineates what she sees as a dominant, androcentric myth of language in which the infant’s acquisition of language depends on the mother’s absence, and the preservation of language requires the absence — mythically, the murder — of the mother. This myth of the death and obviation of the mother for whom an inﬁnite chain of ﬁgures comes to stand has obvi- ous resonance with Frankenstein in the deaths of Caroline, Iustine, and Elizabeth, as well as in the dead or unmentioned and presumably dead mothers of Caroline, Saﬁe, Felix and Agatha De Lacey, and Henry Cler- val, and in the many substitutions of one woman for another (Caro- line’s replacement of Elizabeth in Victor’s dream, or the resemblance Elizabeth and the creature note between Caroline and Iustine). Homans thus argues that “[t]he horror of the demon that Frankenstein creates is that it is its creator’s desire for an object, a desire that never really seeks its own fulﬁllment” (106). Seeing this as evidence that the creature is a ﬁgure of what it feels like to be the “feminine object of [male] desire” (100-01), Homans assimilates erotic relations in the novel to heterosexuality, and assimilates relations between women in the novel to relations of identiﬁcation. Thus although one might expect feminist criticism to address a ﬁc- tion’s representations of all kinds of relations between women, straight feminist criticism of Frankenstein has instead typically repeated the novel’s evasions. As even Smith implicitly assumes a continuum of relationships between women without a point of division between erotic and nonerotic relations, Homans too presents women’s relation to female same-sex relationships as uncomplicated by an intervening break — in this case by the division implied in the triangular structure of the Lacanian Symbolic instigated by the intervention of the phallus. Whereas Homans alludes to male homoeroticism through her dis- cussions of “narcissism” and “solipsism” (106, 104), she more directly addresses, and in doing so more fully displaces, questions of female homoeroticism, in part by assimilating female same-sex desire to identiﬁcation: Because of her likeness to and identiﬁcation with her mother, the daughter does not need a copula [a link, hyphen, or coupler] such as the phallus to make the connection, as the son does. She also does not need a phallus, paradoxically, because she is never toldFRANN MICHEL 357 she may not use it: in a culture already heterosexual, the father would be unlikely to suspect threats to his sexual terrain from that quarter. . . . [A] daughter is never encouraged to abandon her mother in the way that a son is, never needs to replace the lost phallus . . . with other hyphens. (11-l2) Homans here equates affective and erotic connections. But the daugh- ter needs the hyphen or copula precisely to the extent that her bond with the mother is not simply affective but also erotic. Although, as Homans notes, father-daughter incest is authorized by the Law of the Father, mother-daughter incest is not: for the son, the Law of the Father is a taboo on some women; for the daughter, as Gayle Rubin has noted, “it is a taboo on all women” (95). The psychoanalytic text thus codiﬁes the girl’s oedipal moment as the paradigmatic instance of les- bian panic: according to psychoanalytic theory, the daughter turns away from her mother because of the presence of the father — his triangulat- ing gaze disrupts their bond, and precipitates the daughter’s phobic recoil from the possibility of desire between women. Homans argues that “the impossibility of Frankenstein giving [the creature] a female demon, an object of its own desire, aligns the demon with women, who are forbidden to have their own desires” (106). And if the creature is like a woman here, he is speciﬁcally like a woman denied a female object of desire. DIFFERENCE AND DESIRE In making this argument about Frankenstein, of course, one must remember that the categories of the affective and the erotic are cultur- ally constructed and variable. According to Lillian Faderman, for instance, romantic friendship or passionate same-sex love was approved between similarly situated middle- and upper-class European and North American women until the later nineteenth century. Such rela- tionships were considered spiritual and pure, while sex was seen as impure (33). But women whose relations with other women were per- ceived as sexual were indeed stigmatized, so that we cannot say that women’s relations with other women were characterized by a seamless “lesbian continuum”: the introduction of what was understood as sex- ual behavior did open a breach in the range of possible relations. In the late eighteenth century, for example, Ann Seymour Damer suffered partial social ostracism because she was known for pursuing other women sexually and having female lovers; and somewhat later, Ann358 GENDER CRITICISM Lister pursued her love affairs in secret to avoid scandal. Moreover, given the emphasis on similarities between romantic friends, sexual or erotic connection might be signaled by social differences (of class, race, gender style) between intimates. In 1790 Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby, the “Ladies of Llangollyn,” who lived together into the nineteenth century, contemplated a libel suit when a London newspa- per described Butler as “masculine” and Ponsonby as “effeminate”- the ascribed gender difference evidently indicating that their relation- ship was not just romantic but sexual (see Trumbach 125-35). In Woll- stonecraft’s Mary, the impropriety of the afﬂuent Mary’s giving primacy to a relation with a poor woman rather than to marriage is reg- istered by the lodgers’ responses to the women’s bond. As these ex- amples show, both the primacy of relations between women and the differences between the women involved can signal an improperly erotic bond. A synecdoche for the evasion of these improper bonds between women in Frankenstein lies in an incident near the center of the book: one woman’s abandonment of another in the face of that monstrosity. The only women to survive the sight of the creature — indeed, virtually the only female characters to survive the novel at all — are Agatha De Lacey and Saﬁe, two of the cottagers whom the monster sees as his pro- tectors. The creature seeks refuge with the blind father of the De Lacey family, but the other cottagers’ early return forecloses the possibility of sanctuary. “ ‘Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me?’” says the creature. The inarticulate and inarticulable response to monstrosity is all that makes it visible. “Agatha fainted; and Saﬁe, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of the cottage” (121). If sapphic sexuality cannot be seen by the patriarch, it threatens to be all too visible to his children. The women who avert their eyes —who faint or rush out — and who do not attend to each other are those who survive. Those who are touched by the monster, and who stand by each other — Iustine and Elizabeth — die. Though straight feminist readings of Frankenstein have delin- eated relations of identiﬁcation — of mirroring or doubling — be- tween women, the novel also reveals a triangulated and mediated relationship — a relation of differences and, potentially, of desire — among Iustine, Elizabeth, and Caroline. Iustine and Agatha are the only women characters in the novel who are not inserted into hetero- sexual relations. While Agatha’s primary bonds are heterosocial ties to her father and brother, however, Iustine’s primary attachments are to other women. Working-class and unattached to any man, Iustine is thusFRANN MICHEL 359 the most problematic ﬁgure in terms of her potential for erotically tinged relations with other women. The relation between Iustine and Elizabeth adumbrates the limits of women’s friendship in Frankenstein. Elizabeth describes Iustine as “very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty” (p. 68), and as she “whom I loved and esteemed as my sister . . . my play-fellow, my companion, my sister” (pp. 83-84); she tells Ius- tine, “I wish . . . that I were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery” (p. 85). Iustine, falsely convicted of William’s murder, “embraced Elizabeth,” and speaks her ﬁnal words: “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may Heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you” (p. 85). Despite these avowals, the relationship between Iustine and Eliza- beth does not constitute an instance of romantic friendship as discussed by Faderman: the women do not express jealousy, display anxiety about the beloved’s reciprocation of the lover’s feeling, or hope to spend their lives together. Their declarations of feeling are immediately motivated by Iustine’s impending execution, of course, and Elizabeth’s position is circumscribed by her engagement to Victor. The book thus minimizes the romantic aspects of their friendship, since the class difference between them might have blurred romantic into erotic connection. Iustine’s considerably more impassioned statements come not only from a woman scheduled to die the next day, but also from a woman of a class different from that of her “beloved and only friend.” In a passage written by Percy Shelley, Elizabeth reminds Victor that in Geneva “there is less distinction between the several classes of . . . inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their man- ners are more reﬁned and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England” (p. 66; Rieger 61n). Nonetheless, Iustine “learned the duties of a servant” (p. 66), and romantic friendship appears to have occurred chieﬂy if not exclusively between women of similar class positions — usually, in extant represen- tations, between middle-, or upper-class women. Eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century representations of sexual or erotic relationships between women, in contrast, tend to involve hierarchical relationships and / or women of the decadent aristocratic or working classes (particularly actresses and prostitutes). Wollstonecraft’s relation with Farmy Blood, for instance, may have been, as Mary sug- gests, socially risky, in part because the Bloods were poorer than Fanny’s lover. Percy’s interpolation in Frankenstein about Genevan ser- vants thus may have functioned not only to critique the English class structure but also to deﬂect a possible reading of sapphic desire. So,360 GENDER CRITICISM too, the relation between the French Agatha and the Turkish Saﬁe might have had a particularly sapphic charge had Saﬁe not found herself “unable to attend to her friend” when they encountered the monster. Social-structural differences between women, differences of class or race, may themselves have come to signify a genitally sexual, as opposed to a purely romantic, relationship.“ The sisterly bond between Eliza- beth and Iustine is thus doubly constrained. Expressions of mutual devotion between women of different classes might not have clearly signiﬁed romantic friendship, and in any case, either sexual or romantic intimacy between Elizabeth and Iustine would have compromised Elizabeth’s position as innocent victim dependent on her relationship to Victor. Iustine and Elizabeth are initially both adopted daughters of Caro- line, and both subsequently become replacements for her; their appar- ent interchangeability would seem to emphasize their similarities rather than differences. But the relationship between Elizabeth and Iustine does betray the need and danger of the hyphen or copula that Homans discusses. Homans argues that sons seek to represent their lost attach- ments to their mothers through heterosexual desire or ﬁgurative lan- guage, while daughters seek to reproduce or repeat their preoedipal relations to their mothers through childbirth or literal language. But what circulates between Elizabeth and Iustine, and is Iustine’s legal undoing, is a ﬁgurative representation, a signiﬁer: not, as Homans would have it, the reproduction of the mother’s body, but the represen- tation of the mother in the painted miniature of Caroline Beaufort, which Elizabeth gives to William and the creature plants on Iustine after the murder. Elizabeth’s testimony that she would willingly have given the portrait to Iustine is taken by the court not as evidence that Iustine had no reason to kill William to get it, but as evidence of Iustine’s “blackest ingratitude” (p. 82). The sign of the (surrogate) mother connecting the two women is read as demonstrating Iustine’s failure to act “like a most affectionate mother,” her failure to reproduce the mother as herself (p. 82). Iustine has imitated and come to resemble Caroline, but in the process of doing so, Elizabeth observes, “you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress. . . . [S]he paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She thought her the model of all excel- lence” (p. 67). If Iustine’s resemblance to Caroline reduces the difference between them, then her adoration, her minute attention to Caroline’s °B. Ruby Rich takes up this point in the discussion following de Lauretis (274-75).FRANN MICHEL 361 bodily movement, highlights that difference. Like the “watery, clouded eyes of the monster” (p. 157), or like Percy’s vision of disembodied eyes in place of nipples, Iustine’s distinctly articulated eyes express and encode a vital agency. Moreover, that agency, like Mary’s passion for Ann in Wollstonecraft’s novel, is visible to others: it is triangulated ﬁrst through Elizabeth’s gaze, then through the censure of the court. Thus the crime of which Iustine is convicted seems to be her raising the possibility of a relation between women that is not constituted by identiﬁcation. While many readings of Frankenstein have suggested the importance of women’s identiﬁcations with each other, then, the novel also suggests that monstrosity lies in women’s differences from each other. In Victor’s dream following the animation of the creature, he ﬁnds himself embracing Elizabeth, who turns into the corpse of Caro- line, and he then ﬁnds, upon awaking, that he is facing the creature, “[a] mummy again endued with animation” (p. 61). While this epi- sode encodes the possibility of exchanging one woman for another, it also encapsulates the horror of the exchange. The difference between mother and daughter lies in the mother’s repulsiveness (perhaps an echo of Wollstonecraft’s potentially improper relation with Fanny Blood). But the difference between women is also itself monstrous: it is what helps make possible an erotic relation between them. MEN AND MARRIAGE Clearly, then, identiﬁcations of women with each other do not nec- essarily promote the “critical stance toward . . . heterosexual institu- tions” Smith looks for in a lesbian text. Indeed, such identiﬁcations may do just the reverse. Foregrounding women’s sameness occludes the dif- ferences that can signal an erotic challenge to the patriarchal structures of marriage and the family. The critical emphasis on women’s inter- changeability highlights their connections to men, and thus predicates its defense of women on their right to access those connections. Inter- preting the creature as female leads Homans to a reading that sees in Victor’s actions the rejection of women and, concomitantly and implic- itly, of heterosexuality. The particular feminism of this reading thus depends upon feminist allegiance to heterosexuality. Homans repeat- edly characterizes Victor’s sexuality as not “normal” and his desires as narcissistic and solipsistic. She observes that “the demon’s creation amounts to an elaborate circumvention of normal heterosexual procre- ation,” and emphasizes that to “bring a composite corpse to life is to36 2 GENDER CRITICISM circumvent the normal channels of procreation; the demon’s ‘birth’ violates the normal relations of family, especially the normal sexual rela- tion of husband and wife” (101, 103, emphasis added). As Sedgwick has noted, Frankenstein embodies “strongly homophobic mechanisms” (Between 92); it seems also to elicit them. Conversely, as Sedgwick also notes, it is “not always easy (some- times barely possible) to distinguish [‘homosexuality’ and ‘homopho- bia’] from each other” (Between 20). Thus Frankenstein can be seen as both enacting and critiquing male homophobia. The most fully repre- sented emotional bonds in the novel occur between men, as do the major episodes of face-to-face narration. Walton writes to his sister that he longs for a friend: “I desire the company of a man who could sympa- thise with me; whose eyes would reply to mine” (p. 31). Victor agrees with Walton that “we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves — such a friend ought to be — do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures,” and calls his friend Henry Clerval “the most noble of human creatures” (p. 37). Given this emphasis throughout the novel on the values of male friendship, it becomes striking that none of the characters ever consid- ers why Victor is to produce for the creature a female mate, rather than a male fiend (who would, at least, not pose the danger of “children . . . a race of devils . . . propagated upon the earth” [p. 144]). But this omission becomes more comprehensible when we look at the shape of male homophobia in Shelley’s day, and speciﬁcally at the belief that male homosexuality encouraged neglect of women. Louis Crompton, in his Byron and Greek Love, notes that the idea that male homosexuality “produced indifference to women and thereby robbed them of their rights” had “a great vogue in the eighteenth century when it appears in a remarkably wide range of contexts, from philoso- phy to pornography” (50). It appears, for instance, in Percy Shelley’s essay “A Discourse on the Manners of the Ancient Greeks Relative to the Subject of Love,” written the same year Frankenstein was pub- lished. In that work, Percy Shelley argues both that sexual love between men causes neglect of women and that it was itself caused, in ancient Greece, by women’s unworthiness of attention. Women’s equality with men is thus doubly incompatible with male homosexuality. In refuting objections to male homosexuality, Ieremy Bentham in 1785 and 1814 gave most attention to this idea of the neglect of women, emphasizing that he did not think male homosexuality “discourages men from mar- rying. Only matrimony can gratify the desire for children, for family alliances” (qtd. in Crompton 51). If a male same-sex relation took theFRANN MICHEL 363 place not of marriage but of pre- or extramarital affairs, it would not rob women of their “rights” to marry and procreate. The “neglect of women” argument would, of course, carry little weight if women did not mind being neglected. Wollstonecraft, for ex- ample, did not mind; she early declared herself averse to marriage and, with Fanny Blood and her sisters, set up a school, for a time living inde- pendently with them. As Sedgwick points out, then, we cannot say that “homophobia is a necessary consequence of such patriarchal institutions as heterosexual marriage” (Between 3). Yet perceived shifts in such insti- tutions can contribute to heightened terror about sexual practices that fall outside their parameters. In this way the argument that “male homosexuality is an epitome, a personiﬁcation, an effect, or perhaps a primary cause of woman hating” intersects with women’s investment in and perception of threats to institutions of heterosexuality (Between 19-20). But while some of Shelley’s contemporaries viewed male homosex- uality as leading to an unfair “neglect of women” (Crompton 51), in Frankenstein the real harms to women come not from this male desire but from the view of it as monstrous, from the failure to acknowledge it, and from the persistent attempt to achieve its sublimation through the subordination of women. When Elizabeth offers to release Victor from their engagement, asking, “Do you not love another?” (p. 161), she has, as Homans notes, hit upon the real source of division between her and Victor: there is someone else. But if Elizabeth had not married Victor, the creature would not have killed her; just so, if Victor had not turned away from his desire for the creature, it would not have killed William or framed Iustine for the murder. The “neglect of women” argument against male homosexuality, then, seems to presume women’s heterosexuality. But the “harms to women” argument against male homophobia seems also to have left in place women’s presumptive heterosexuality. The repression of homo- sexual desire in men evidently heterosexual redounds upon women: as conduits or objects of exchange between men whose desire for each other is repressed, women become not merely objects, but objects of hostility. (Victor’s rather ludicrous inability to comprehend the mon- ster’s obvious threats against Elizabeth is entirely legible as evidence of Victor’s hostility toward her.) As Terry Castle notes, bonds between women would disrupt this structure of exchange between men (132). And as Sedgwick argues, “homophobia directed by men against men is misogynistic . . . [that is,] oppressive of women” (Between 20). While the homophobic link between homosexuality and “neglect of women”364 GENDER CRITICISM has relied on women’s investments in heterosexual institutions, Frankenstein’s critique of the dangers of male homophobia to women itself relies upon a suspension of erotic connections between women in the novel. The idea that male homosexuality is linked to misogyny is thus in part a function of embeddedness in what we would now call the institu- tion of heterosexuality. Bentham’s response to the “neglect of women” argument indicates the wider cultural context at the time of his writing, when he points to the material anxieties at work in pitting women against homosexual men. The marriage market in Georgian England was apparently a difﬁcult one for women.7 Insofar as homosexuality was beginning to be perceived as an identity, it was apparently begin- ning to be thought of as a potential life choice that would exclude mar- riage. Women’s economic and social dependence on the institution of marriage would, understandably, put them at odds with perceived threats to that central female livelihood, as well as threats of harm from within it. Writing in 1985, Louis Crompton suggests that the “neglect of women” argument “seems strange to us. Nowadays, women and ho- mosexuals tend to make common cause politically on the ground that both suffer from invidious sex-role stereotyping” (50). But of course Homans’s reading of Frankenstein turns on a variant of that seemingly strange argument: it is not that male homosexuality leads to a neglect of women, but, conversely, that the wish for the deferral of the desire for the mother leads to a view of actual women’s bodies as repellent, and thus to an avoidance of women and to an abnormal, narcissistic sexuality. Invisible as the monster is to the reader, he inspires in those who see him a reaction that is quite visible to others, and that provides, indeed, a fulcrum for the narrative. So, too, the deferred possibility of sapphic sexuality in the novel, invisible as it apparently is to the characters as well as to most readers, can nonetheless be indirectly discerned through the sapphic intertexts for terriﬁed responses to the creature. Potentially erotic relations of difference between women can be a source of horror in Shelley’s text, elided or recast as relations of identiﬁcation. That eli- sion, paradoxically, provides the linchpin of such critique of male 7“The disproportionate number of socially and economically suitable bachelors . . . meant that a woman had less choice as to her future husband; the complaisance of male suitors, who took their success for granted, is a commonplace of eighteenth-century nov- els, as is the sad circumstance of uncourted daughters” (Poovey 13).FRANN MICHEL 365 el homosexual panic as the novel offers, and has provided the crux of the canonical straight feminist readings of the novel as well. Western culture’s “chronic, now endemic crisis of homo/hetero- sexual deﬁnition” may be, as Sedgwick suggests, “indicatively male,” but it is hardly exclusively so (Epistemology 1). Lesbian-baiting has an infamous, lengthy, and still evolving history. Moreover, the oedipal conﬁgurations that crystallized with male homosexual panic are equally, albeit differently, inextricable from lesbian panic. Where the paranoid Gothic constitutes male homosexual panic as a dyadic structure in which one man is persecuted by another, the female-authored paranoid Gothic also constitutes lesbian panic as the effect of a triangulated structure in which one woman’s relation to another is seen by a third party as monstrous, improper, or monstrously improper. Rather than functioning as a pervasive theme, lesbian panic emerges brieﬂy, obliquely, or tangentially, and its deferral undergirds the narrative.8 Study of the textual relationships and intertextual references within Frankenstein thus reveals that speculative questions about relations between women in the novel turn out to be specular questions about how those relations are and are not to be seen, and how they are (not) seen by critics. Such omissions in straight feminist readings of the novel seem the product of critical anxiety about a potential lesbian subtext. One now-standard mode of dealing with that anxiety is to present erotic desire between women as simply one expression of affectional relation, and thus to elide what is speciﬁcally erotic about such desire. When that desire cannot be assimilated to affectional relations or rela- tions of identiﬁcation, it becomes a source of horror. The ﬁt between “My description of male homosexual panic in the “paranoid Gothic” here relies on Sedgwick’s accounts in Between Men (especially 91) and Epistemology of the Closet (espe- cially 187). In Arm Radcliffe’s The Italian (1797), the captive Ellena’s relationship with the kind Olivia must be hidden from the other nuns in the convent. An epigraph to an earlier chapter in the novel, drawn from the love scene between Shakespeare's Olivia and Viola in Twelﬁh Night in which Olivia falls in love with the disguised Viola (I. 5.268-77), pro- vides a potentially sapphic intertext shaping our readings of the scenes between Rad- cliffe’s Olivia and Ellena. Ellena is “fascinated by this interesting nun,” and her ﬁrst comment about Olivia is, “She is very handsome” (87). Vivaldi’s anxiety about the pos- sible primacy of the bond between the women is revealed in his comment, “Ah, Ellena! . . . do I then hold only the second place in your heart?”, to which Ellena replies only with “a smile more eloquent than words” (135). The potential eros of the interac- tions between the two women is recuperated as identiﬁcation and inscribed within the oedipal family by the discovery not only that the agent of Ellena’s captivity is the man she believes to be her father but also that Olivia is her mother. -I! flfl _"366 GENDER CRITICISM the deferral of lesbian panic and the embodiment of mechanisms of male homophobia in Frankenstein and in critical responses to the novel reveals not a lesbian continuum, but the beginnings of the discontinu- ities by which women’s differences even now become divisions.

To the question “What is Marxist criticism?” it may be tempting to respond with another question: “What does it matter?” In light of the rapid and largely unanticipated demise of Soviet-style communism in the former USSR and throughout Eastern Europe, it is understandable to suppose that Marxist literary analysis would disappear too, quickly becoming an anachronism in a world enamored with full-market capitalism. In fact, however, there is no reason why Marxist criticism should weaken, let alone disappear. It is, after all, a phenomenon distinct from Soviet and Eastern European communism, having had its beginnings nearly eighty years before the Bolshevik revolution and having thrived since the 1940s, mainly in the West — not as a form of communist pro- paganda but rather as a form of critique, a discourse for interrogating all societies and their texts in terms of certain speciﬁc issues. Those issues — including race, class, and the attitudes shared within a given culture — are as much with us as ever, not only in contemporary Russia but also in the United States. The argument could even be made that Marxist criticism has been strengthened by the collapse of Soviet-style communism. There was a time, after all, when few self-respecting Anglo-American journals would 368WHAT IS MARXIST CRITICISM? 369 use Marxist terms or models, however illuminating, to analyze Western issues or problems. It smacked of sleeping with the enemy. With the collapse of the Kremlin, however, old taboos began to give way. Even the staid Wall Street ]ournal now seems comfortable using phrases like “worker alienation” to discuss the problems plaguing the American business world. The assumption that Marxist criticism will die on the vine of a mori- bund political system rests in part on another mistaken assumption, namely, that Marxist literary analysis is practiced only by people who would like to see society transformed into a Marxist-communist state, one created through land reform, the redistribution of wealth, a tightly and centrally managed economy, the abolition of institutionalized reli- gion, and so on. In fact, it has never been necessary to be a communist political revolutionary to be classiﬁed as a Marxist literary critic. (Many of the critics discussed in this introduction actually ﬂed communist soci- eties to live in the West.) Nor is it necessary to like only those literary works with a radical social vision or to dislike books that represent or even reinforce a middle-class, capitalist worldview. It is necessary, how- ever, to adopt what most students of literature would consider a radical deﬁnition of the purpose and function of literary criticism. More traditional forms of criticism, according to the Marxist critic Pierre Macherey, “set . . . out to deliver the text from its own silences by coaxing it into giving up its true, latent, or hidden meaning.” Inevitably, however, non-Marxist criticism “intrude[s] its own dis- course between the reader and the text” (qtd. in Bennett 107). Marxist critics, by contrast, do not attempt to discover hidden meanings in texts. Or if they do, they do so only after seeing the text, ﬁrst and fore- most, as a material product to be understood in broadly historical terms. That is to say, a literary work is ﬁrst viewed as a product of work (and hence of the realm of production and consumption we call eco- nomics). Second, it may be looked upon as a work that does identi- ﬁable work of its own. At one level, that work is usually to enforce and reinforce the prevailing ideology, that is, the network of conventions, values, and opinions to which the majority of people uncritically subscribe. This does not mean that Marxist critics merely describe the obvi- ous. Quite the contrary: the relationship that the Marxist critic Terry Eagleton outlines in Criticism and Ideology (1978) among the soaring cost of books in the nineteenth century, the growth of lending libraries, the practice of publishing “three-decker” novels (so that three borrow- ers could be reading the same book at the same time), and the changing370 MARXIST CRITICISM content of those novels is highly complex in its own way. But the com- plexity Eagleton ﬁnds is not that of the deeply buried meaning of the text. Rather, it is that of the complex web of social and economic rela- tionships that were prerequisite to the work’s production. Marxist criti- cism does not seek to be, in Eagleton’s words, “a passage from text to reader.” Indeed, “its task is to show the text as it cannot know itself, to manifest those conditions of its making (inscribed in its very letter) about which it is necessarily silent” (43). As everyone knows, Marxism began with Karl Marx, the nineteenth- century German philosopher best known for writing Das Kapital, the seminal work of the communist movement. What everyone doesn’t know is that Marx was also the ﬁrst Marxist literary critic (much as Sigmund Freud, who psychoanalyzed E. T. A. Hoffmann’s super- natural tale “The Sandman,” was the ﬁrst Freudian literary critic). Dur- ing the 1830s Marx wrote critical essays on writers such as Goethe and Shakespeare (whose tragic vision of Elizabethan disintegration he praised). The fact that Marxist literary criticism began with Marx himself is hardly surprising, given Marx’s education and early interests. Trained in the classics at the University of Bonn, Marx wrote literary imitations, his own poetry, a failed novel, and a fragment of a tragic drama (Oulanem) before turning to contemplative and political philosophy. Even after he met Friedrich Engels in 1843 and began collaborating on works such as The German Ideology and The Communist Manifesto, Marx maintained a keen interest in literary writers and their works. He and Engels argued about the poetry of Heinrich Heine, admired Her- mann Freiligrath (a poet critical of the German aristocracy), and faulted the playwright Ferdinand Lassalle for writing about a reactionary knight in the Peasants’ War rather than about more progressive aspects of German history. As these examples suggest, Marx and Engels would not — indeed, could not --- think of aesthetic matters as being distinct and indepen- dent from such things as politics, economics, and history. Not surpris- ingly, they viewed the alienation of the worker in industrialized, capitalist societies as having grave consequences for the arts. I-Iow can people mechanically stamping out things that bear no mark of their producer’s individuality (people thereby “reiﬁed,” turned into things themselves) be expected to recognize, produce, or even consume things of beauty? And if there is no one to consume something, thereWHAT IS MARXIST CRITICISM? 371 will soon be no one to produce it, especially in an age in which produc- tion (even of something like literature) has come to mean mass (and therefore proﬁtable) production. In The German Ideology (1846), Marx and Engels expressed their sense of the relationship between the arts, politics, and basic economic reality in terms of a general social theory. Economics, they argued, prow-des the “base” or “infrastructure” of society, but from that base emerges a “superstructure” consisting of law, politics, philosophy, reli- gion, and art. Marx later admitted that the relationship between base and super- structure may be indirect and ﬂuid: every change in economics may not be reﬂected by an immediate change in ethics or literature. In The Eigh- teenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852), he came up with the word homology to describe the sometimes unbalanced, often delayed, and almost always loose correspondence between base and superstructure. And later in that same decade, while working on an introduction to his Political Economy, Marx further relaxed the base-superstructure rela- tionship. Writing on the excellence of ancient Greek art (versus the primitive nature of ancient Greek economics), he conceded that a gap sometimes opens up between base and superstructure — between eco- nomic forms and those produced by the creative mind. Nonetheless, at base the old formula was maintained. Economics remained basic and the connection between economics and superstruc- tural elements of society was reafﬁrmed. Central to Marxism and Marx- ist literary criticism was and is the following “materialist” insight: consciousness, without which such things as art cannot be produced, is not the source of social forms and economic conditions. It is, rather, their most important product. Marx and Engels, drawing upon the philosopher G. W. F. Hegel’s theories about the dialectical synthesis of ideas out of theses and antitheses, believed that a revolutionary class war (pitting the capitalist class against a proletarian, antithetical class) would lead eventually to the synthesis of a new social and economic order. Placing their faith not in the idealist Hegelian dialectic but, rather, in what they called “dialec- tical materialism,” they looked for a secular and material salvation of humanity — one in, not beyond, history — via revolution and not via divine intervention. And they believed that the communist society eventually established would be one capable of producing new forms of consciousness and belief and therefore, ultimately, great art.372 MARXIST CRITICISM The revolution anticipated by Marx and Engels did not occur in their century, let alone lifetime. When it ﬁnally did take place, it didn’t happen in places where Marx and Engels had thought it might be suc- cessful: the United States, Great Britain, and Germany. It happened, rather, in 1917 Russia, a country long ruled by despotic czars but also enlightened by the works of powerful novelists and playwrights, includ- ing Chekhov, Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Dostoyevsky. Perhaps because of its signiﬁcant literary tradition, Russia produced revolutionaries like V.I. Lenin, who shared not only Marx’s interest in literature but also his belief in literature’s ultimate importance. But it was not without some hesitation that Lenin endorsed the signiﬁcance of texts written during the reign of the czars. Well before 1917 he had questioned what the relationship should be between a society undergo- ing a revolution and the great old literature of its bourgeois past. Lenin attempted to answer that question in a series of essays on Tol- stoy that he wrote between 1908 and 1911. Tolstoy — the author of War and Peace and Anna Karenina — was an important nineteenth- century Russian writer whose views did not accord with all of those of young Marxist revolutionaries. Continuing interest in a writer like Tol- stoy may be justiﬁed, Lenin reasoned, given the primitive and unen- lightened economic order of the society that produced him. Since superstructure usually lags behind base (and is therefore usually more primitive), the attitudes of a Tolstoy were relatively progressive when viewed in light of the monarchical and precapitalist society out of which they arose. Moreover, Lenin also reasoned, the writings of the great Russian realists would have to sufﬁce, at least in the short run. Lenin looked for- ward, in essays like “Party Organization and Party Literature,” to the day in which new artistic forms would be produced by progressive writ- ers with revolutionary political views and agendas. But he also knew that a great proletarian literature was unlikely to evolve until a thoroughly literate proletariat had been produced by the educational system. Lenin was hardly the only revolutionary leader involved in setting up the new Soviet state who took a strong interest in literary matters. In 1924 Leon Trotsky published a book called Literature and Revolution, which is still acknowledged as a classic of Marxist literary criticism. Trotsky worried about the direction in which Marxist aesthetic the- ory seemed to be going. He responded skeptically to groups like Pro- letkult, which opposed tolerance toward pre- and nonrevolutionary writers, and which called for the establishment of a new, proletarian cul-WHAT IS MARXIST CRITICISM? 373 ture. Trotsky warned of the danger of cultural sterility and risked unpopularity by pointing out that there is no necessary connection between the quality of a literary work and the quality of its author’s politics. In 1927 Trotsky lost a power struggle with Iosef Stalin, a man who believed, among other things, that writers should be “engineers” of “human souls.” After Trotsky’s expulsion from the Soviet Union, views held by groups like Proletkult and the Left Front of Art (LEF), and by theorists such as Nikolai Bukharin and A. A. Zhdanov, became more prevalent. Speaking at the First Congress of the Union of Soviet Writers in 1934, the Soviet author Maxim Gorky called for writing that would “make labor the principal hero of our books.” It was at the same writ- ers’ congress that “socialist realism,” an art form glorifying workers and the revolutionary State, was made Communist party policy and the ofﬁ- cial literary form of the USSR. Of the writers active in the USSR after the expulsion of Trotsky and the unfortunate triumph of Stalin, two critics stand out. One, Mikhail Bakhtin, was a Russian, later a Soviet, critic who spent much of his life in a kind of internal exile. Many of his essays were written in the 1930s and not published in the West or translated until the late 1960s. His work comes out of an engagement with the Marxist intellectual tradi- tion as well as out of an indirect, even hidden, resistance to the Soviet government. It has been important to Marxist critics writing in the West because his theories provide a means to decode submerged social critique, especially in early modern texts. He viewed language — espe- cially literary texts —. in terms of discourses and dialogues. Within a novel written in a society in ﬂux, for instance, the narrative may include an ofﬁcial, legitimate discourse, plus another inﬁltrated by challenging comments and even retorts. In a 1929 book on Dostoyevsky and a 1940 study titled Rabelais and His World, Bakhtin examined what he calls “polyphonic” novels, each characterized by a multiplicity of voices or discourses. In Dostoyevsky the independent status of a given charac- ter is marked by the difference of his or her language from that of the narrator. (The narrator’s voice, too, can in fact be a dialogue.) In works by Rabelais, Bakhtin ﬁnds that the (profane) language of the carnival and of other popular festivals plays against and parodies the more ofﬁ- cial discourses, that is, of the king, church, or even socially powerful intellectuals. Bakhtin inﬂuenced modern cultural criticism by show- ing, in a sense, that the conﬂict between “high” and “low” culture takes place not only between classic and popular texts but also between374 MARXIST CRITICISM the “dialogic” voices that exist within many books — whether “high” or “low.” The other subtle Marxist critic who managed to survive Stalin’s dic- tatorship and his repressive policies was Georg Lukécs. A Hungarian who had begun his career as an “idealist” critic, Lukacs had converted to Marxism in 1919; renounced his earlier, Hegelian work shortly thereafter; visited Moscow in 1930-31; and ﬁnally emigrated to the USSR in 1933, just one year before the First Congress of the Union of Soviet Writers met. Lukacs was far less narrow in his views than the most strident Stalinist Soviet critics of the 1930s and 1940s. He dis- liked much socialist realism and appreciated prerevolutionary, realistic novels that broadly reﬂected cultural “totalities”— and were populated with characters representing human “types” of the author’s place and time. (Lukacs was particularly fond of the historical canvasses painted by the early nineteenth-century novelist Sir Walter Scott.) But like his ‘more rigid and censorious contemporaries, he drew the line at accept- ing nonrevolutionary, modernist works like Iames Ioyce’s Ulysses. He condemned movements like expressionism and symbolism, preferring works with “content” over more decadent, experimental works charac- terized mainly by “form.” With Lukacs its most liberal and tolerant critic from the early 1930s until well into the 1960s, the Soviet literary scene degenerated to the point that the works of great writers like Franz Kaﬂca were no longer read, either because they were viewed as decadent, formal experiments or because they “engineered souls” in “nonprogressive” directions. Ofﬁcially sanctioned works were generally ones in which artistry lagged far behind the politics (no matter how bad the politics were). Fortunately for the Marxist critical movement, politically radical critics outside the Soviet Union were free of its narrow, constricting policies and, consequently, able fruitfully to develop the thinking of Marx, Engels, and Trotsky. It was these non-Soviet Marxists who kept Marxist critical theory alive and useful in discussing all kinds of litera- ture, written across the entire historical spectrum. Perhaps because Lukacs was the best of the Soviet communists writing Marxist criticism in the 1930s and 1940s, non-Soviet Marx- ists tended to develop their ideas by publicly opposing those of Lukacs. German dramatist and critic Bertolt Brecht countered Lukacs by arguing that art ought to be viewed as a ﬁeld of production, not as a container of “content.” Brecht also criticized Lukacs for his attempt to enshrine realism at the expense not only of other “isms” butWHAT IS MARXIST CRITICISM? 375 also of poetry and drama, both of which had been largely ignored by Lukacs. Even more outspoken was Brecht’s critical champion Walter Ben- jamin, a German Marxist who, in the 1930s, attacked those conven- tional and traditional literary forms conveying a stultifying “aura” of culture. Benjamin praised dadaism and, more important, new forms of art ushered in by the age of mechanical reproduction. Those forms — including radio and ﬁlm — offered hope, he felt, for liberation from capitalist culture, for they were too new to be part of its stultifyingly rit- ualistic traditions. But of all the anti-Lukacsians outside the USSR who made a contri- bution to the development of Marxist literary criticism, the most important was probably Theodor Adorno. Leader since the early 1950s of the Frankfurt school of Marxist criticism, Adorno attacked Lukacs for his dogmatic rejection of nonrealist modern literature and for his belief in the primacy of content over form. Art does not equal science, Adorno insisted. He went on to argue for art’s autonomy from empiri- cal forms of knowledge and to suggest that the interior monologues of modernist works (by Beckett and Proust) reﬂect the fact of modern alienation in a way that Marxist criticism ought to ﬁnd compelling. In addition to turning against Lukacs and his overly constrictive canon, Marxists outside the Soviet Union were able to take advantage of insights generated by non-Marxist critical theories being developed in post-World War II Europe. One of the movements that came to be of interest to non-Soviet Marxists was structuralism, a scientiﬁc approach to the study of humankind whose proponents believed that all elements of culture, including literature, could be understood as parts of a system of signs. Using modern linguistics as a model, structuralists like Claude Le'vi-Strauss broke down the myths of various cultures into “mythemes” in an attempt to show that there are structural correspon- dences, or homologies, between the mythical elements produced by various human communities across time. Of the European structuralist Marxists, one of the most inﬂuen- tial was Lucien Goldmann, a Rumanian critic living in Paris. Goldmann combined structuralist principles with Marx’s base-superstructure model in order to show how economics determines the mental struc- tures of social groups, which are reﬂected in literary texts. Gold- mann rejected the idea of individual human genius, choosing to see works, instead, as the “collective” products of “trans-individual” men- tal structures. In early studies, such as The Hidden God (1955), he related seventeenth-century French texts (such as Racine’s Phedre) to376 MARXIST CRITICISM the ideology of Iansenism. In later works, he applied Marx’s base- superstructure model even more strictly, describing a relationship between economic conditions and texts unmediated by an intervening, collective consciousness. In spite of his rigidity and perhaps because of his afﬁnities with structuralism, Goldmann came to be seen in the 1960s as the propo- nent of a kind of watered-down, “humanist” Marxism. He was cer- tainly viewed that way by the French Marxist Louis Althusser, a disciple not of Lévi-Strauss and structuralism but rather of the psychoanalytic theorist Iacques Lacan and of the Italian communist Antonio Gramsci, famous for his writings about ideology and “hegemony.” (Gramsci used the latter word to refer to the pervasive, weblike system of assump- tions and values that shapes the way things look, what they mean, and therefore what reality is for the majority of people within a culture.) Like Gramsci, Althusser viewed literary works primarily in terms of their relationship to ideology, the function of which, he argued, is to (re)produce the existing relations of production in a given society. Dave Laing, in The Marxist Theory of Art (1978), has attempted to explain this particular insight of Althusser by saying that ideologies, through the “ensemble of habits, moralities, and opinions” that can be found in any literary text, “ensure that the work-force (and those responsible for re-producing them in the family, school, etc.) are maintained in their position of subordination to the dominant class” (91). This is not to say that Althusser thought of the masses as a brainless multitude following only the dictates of the prevailing ideology: Althusser followed Gramsci in suggesting that even working-class people have some freedom to struggle against ideology and to change history. Nor is it to say that Althusser saw ideology as being a coherent, consistent force. In fact, he saw it as being riven with contradictions that works of literature some- times expose and even widen. Thus Althusser followed Marx and Gramsci in believing that although literature must be seen in relation to ideology, it — like all social forms — has some degree of autonomy. Althusser’s followers included Pierre Macherey, who in A Theory of Literary Production (1978) developed Althusser’s concept of the rela- tionship between literature and ideology. A realistic novelist, he argued, attempts to produce a uniﬁed, coherent text, but instead ends up pro- ducing a work containing lapses, omissions, gaps. This happens because within ideology there are subjects that cannot be covered, things that cannot be said, contradictory views that aren’t recognized as contradic- tory. (The critic’s challenge, in this case, is to supply what the text can- not say, thereby making sense of gaps and contradictions.)WHAT IS MARXIST CRITICISM? 377 :1-' But there is another reason why gaps open up and contradictions become evident in texts. Works don’t just reﬂect ideology (which Gold- mann had referred to as “myth” and which Macherey refers to as a sys- tem of “illusory social beliefs”); they are also “ﬁctions,” works of art, products of ideology that have what Goldmann would call a “world- w-ew” to offer. What kind of product, Macherey implicitly asks, is iden- tical to the thing that produced it? It is hardly surprising, then, that Balzac’s ﬁction shows French peasants in two different lights, only one of which is critical and judgmental, only one of which is baldly ideological. Writing approvingly on Macherey and Macherey’s mentor Althusser in Marxism and Literary Criticism (1976), Terry Eagleton says: “It is by giving ideology a determinate form, ﬁxing it within cer- tain ﬁctional limits, that art is able to distance itself from [ideology], thus revealing . . . [its] limits” (19). A follower of Althusser, Macherey is sometimes referred to as a “post-Althusserian Marxist.” Eagleton, too, is often described that way, as is his American contemporary Fredric Iameson. Iameson and Eagle- ton, as well as being post-Althusserians, are also among the few Anglo- American critics who have closely followed and signiﬁcantly developed Marxist thought. Before them, Marxist interpretation in English was limited to the work of a handful of critics: Christopher Caudwell, Christopher Hill, Arnold Kettle, E. P. Thompson, and Raymond Williams. Of these, Williams was perhaps least Marxist in orientation: he felt that Marxist critics, ironically, tended too much to isolate economics from culture; that they overlooked the individualism of people, opting instead to see them as “masses”; and that even more ironically, they had become an elitist group. But if the least Marxist of the British Marxists, Williams was also by far the most inﬂuential. Preferring to talk about “culture” instead of ideology, Williams argued in works such as Culture and Soci- ety 1780-1950 (1958) that culture is “lived experience” and, as such, an interconnected set of social properties, each and all grounded in and inﬂuencing history. Terry Eagleton’s Criticism and Ideology (1978) is in many ways a response to the work of Williams. Responding to Williams’s statement in Culture and Society that “there are in fact no masses; there are only ways of seeing people as masses” (289), Eagleton writes: That men and women really are now unique individuals was Williams’s (unexceptionable) insistence; but it was a proposition .171 ' '_378 MARXIST CRITICISM bought at the expense of perceiving the fact that they must mass and fight to achieve their full individual humanity. One has only to adapt Williams's statement to “There are in fact no classes; there are only ways of seeing people as classes” to expose its theoretical paucity. (Criticism 29) Eagleton goes on, in Criticism and Ideology, to propose an elaborate theory about how history — in the form of “general,” “authorial,” and “aesthetic” ideology — enters texts, which in turn may revivify, open up, or critique those same ideologies, thereby setting in motion a process that may alter history. He shows how texts by Jane Austen, Matthew Arnold, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Joseph Conrad, and T. S. Eliot deal with and transmute conflicts at the heart of the general and author- ial ideologies behind them: conflicts between morality and individual- ism, and between individualism and social organicism and utilitarianism. As all this emphasis on ideology and conflict suggests, a modern British Marxist like Eagleton, even while acknowledging the work of a British Marxist predecessor like Williams, is more nearly developing the ideas of Continental Marxists like Althusser and Macherey. That holds, as well, for modern American Marxists like Fredric Jameson. For although he makes occasional, sympathetic references to the works of Williams, Thompson, and Hill, Jameson makes far more use of Lukács, Adorno, and Althusser as well as non-Marxist structuralist, psychoana- lytic, and poststructuralist critics. In the first of several influential works, Marxism and Form (1971), Jameson takes up the question of form and content, arguing that the former is “but the working out” of the latter “in the realm of super- structure” (329). (In making such a statement Jameson opposes not only the tenets of Russian formalists, for whom content had merely been the fleshing out of form, but also those of so-called vulgar Marx- ists, who tended to define form as mere ornamentation or window dressing.) In his later work The Political Unconscious (1981), Jameson uses what in Marxism and Form he had called “dialectical criticism” to synthesize out of structuralism and poststructuralism, Freud and Lacan, Althusser and Adorno, a set of complex arguments that can only be summarized reductively. The fractured state of societies and the isolated condition of indi- viduals, he argues, may be seen as indications that there originally existed an unfallen state of something that may be called “primitive communism.” History — which records the subsequent divisions andWHAT IS MARXIST CRITICISM? 379 alienations — limits awareness of its own contradictions and of that lost, Better State, via ideologies and their manifestation in texts whose strategies essentially contain and repress desire, especially revolutionary desire, into the collective unconscious. (In Conrad’s Lord ]im, Iameson shows, the knowledge that governing classes don’t deserve their power is contained and repressed by an ending that metaphysically blames Nature for the tragedy and that melodramatically blames wicked Gen- tleman Brown.) As demonstrated by Iameson in analyses like the one mentioned above, textual strategies of containment and concealment may be dis- covered by the critic, but only by the critic practicing dialectical criti- cism, that is to say, a criticism aware, among other things, of its own status as ideology. All thought, Iameson concludes, is ideological; only through ideological thought that knows itself as such can ideologies be seen through and eventually transcended. In the Marxist interpretation of Frankenstein that follows, Warren Montag begins his interpretive encounter with Mary Shelley’s novel by arguing that a literary work creates the illusion of autonomy while depending, in fact, on history for meaning. (He thus steers a course between Althusser, for whom literary works are at least semiau- tonomous, and critics like Eagleton, for whom they are not.) Montag proceeds, then, by attempting to “[ascertain] the character of the sec- ond decade of the nineteenth century, and more generally the period of English (and to a certain extent European) history between the French Revolution of 1789 and the period of relative social stability that set in with the passage of the Reform Bill in 1832 in England” (p. 384 in this volume). Using the text to establish that the novel is set in the 1790s, the period of the French Revolution, Montag shows how the novel at once reveals and masks that fact, telling us that Victor Frankenstein is plan- ning to create his monster one hundred and ﬁfty years after the English Revolution (of 1642). The passage referring to that earlier revolt against monarchy turns out to be surprisingly conservative in its impli- cations — oddly conservative, in fact, given Mary Shelley’s supposed radicalism. Montag explains that conservatism by remounting E. P. Thompson’s argument that the French Revolution had produced a kind of monster in Europe, a mood of amorality and anarchy that had infected England and come to raise fears, even among some radicals, that England itself was on the brink of chaos.380 MARXIST CRITICISM After all, the formation ofthe working class as a class had led to rev- olutionary working-class political movements such as the Luddite movement, which in turn had led to violent mass demonstrations and machine-smashing incidents. These movements and incidents had shown English working people to be militant and combative toward the middle class as well as toward the aristocracy. Mary Shelley had seen this as well as anyone, and the sight could only have made her fearful, if also excited. “Shelley’s work,” according to Montag, “is incontestably inter- woven in this history: it bears witness to the birth of that monster, simultaneously the object of pity and fear, the industrial working class” (p. 387). We come to realize as we follow Montag’s argument further, how- ever, that to read Frankenstein as a work in which monster equals prole- tariat is to read as a somewhat simplistic Marxist critic. So Montag proceeds to another level of the text, as well as to other levels of Marxist critical discourse that we may associate with Macherey, Eagleton, and Iameson. To ﬁnd the history in the text — rather than seeing the text as a simpleminded allegory of history — Montag goes back to it in search of “the contradictions, discrepancies, and inconsistencies that the work displays but does not address or attempt to resolve” (p. 390). In doing so, he begins practicing a form of Marxism that combines Macherey’s conviction that the profoundest historical meaning of a work lies in what the work cannot say, what ideology of the day will not let it say, with a neo-Hegelian interest in form. For the telling contradictions Montag ﬁnds in Frankenstein, the discrepancies that hide what it can- not say as often involve disruptions of aesthetic unity as they do contra- dictory ideas or “contents.” What Frankenstein leaves out — what is conspicuously and signiﬁ- cantly absent — is not that in creating a working class, England has cre- ated a monster. That, rather, is what the work virtually says outright. It is, rather, that science, or more precisely the technology that the Age of Reason has made possible (and that the Enlightenment would tell us will assure human progress), can in fact be alienating and dehumaniz- ing, could in fact cause society to grow, if anything, weaker and turn human beings into a lower form of life. In making that absence in the text present, Marxist criticism surely makes Frankenstein present in the temporal as well as in the spatial sense — that is, as a work able to speak provocatively of and to the historical epoch in which it is now being read.

A Marxist reading of a literary work begins with a refusal of this illusion of autonomy and seeks instead to restore to the work that peculiar form of dependence that its very structure is designed to mask or deny. For the literary text is in no way independent of the historical moment in which it emerged. It is not a closed, self-contained whole whose meaning would derive from itself alone. On the contrary, it is no more than a “node within a network” (Foucault 19). The work is bound both to the literary and nonliterary discourses with which it coexists (and in relation to which alone it possesses a meaning), and to the “non-discursive” social, eco- nomic, and political practices that make discourse possible. We are thus obliged to begin our investigation of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein by ascertaining the character of the second decade of the nineteenth century, and more generally the period of English (and to a certain extent European) history between the French Revolution of 1789 and the period of relative social stability that set in with the pas- sage of the Reform Bill in 1832 in England. Even the most cursory examination of this singular period reveals that its key themes are pre- cisely those of Frankenstein: there is everywhere a sense of monstrous forces unwittingly conjured up in order to serve the project of progress and the Enlightenment but that have ultimately served to call that very project into question. The French Revolution, unquestionably the major event of the period, had apparently come to a close just prior to the publication of Frankenstein, with the ﬁnal defeat of Napoleon in 1815. Iean- Iacques Lecercle has demonstrated that although not once mentioned in Frankenstein, the French Revolution is nevertheless alluded to (Lecercle). Walton’s letters to his sister are dated but with the decade and year omitted (for example, 28 March 17 — ). A passage that occurs rather late in the text, however, allows us to determine the years duringWARREN MONTAG 385 which the action of the novel takes place. Victor Frankenstein, accom- panied by his fiend Henry Clerval, journeys to Scotland seeking a remote spot in which he can work to fulﬁll his promise to create a mate to relieve the monster’s terrible solitude. When they stop brieﬂy in Oxford, Frankenstein records the following sentiments: As we entered this city, our minds were ﬁlled with the remem- brance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty. (p. 140) Frankenstein’s meditation on the Revolution of 1642 in England locates the narrative in the 1790s, placing it in the midst of the French Revolution. It is indeed remarkable that the work refers to a revolution that occurred “more than a century and a half before” rather than to the most important event of contemporary history. But the absence of the French Revolution from the text is not the only surprising fact in this passage. Its tone is unexpectedly sympathetic to Charles I, a monarch typically regarded by Whigs (the moderates of the day), let alone the Radicals of Shelley’s circle, as the very ﬁgure of a tyrant. His absolutist policies, his refusal to base his rule on the consent of Parlia- ment, his abolition of religious freedom were all held to be the causes of the English civil war that began in 1642 and ended in 1649 when Charles was executed by order of Parliament. Two discrepancies have thus appeared: (1) a substitution of the En- glish revolution of one hundred ﬁfty years earlier for the French; (2) a brief commentary on the English civil war that is at odds with every- thing we know of Mary Shelley’s political sympathies. But these dis- crepancies are precisely what will allow us to proceed from the work to the history on which it depends and that made it possible. For the English and the French revolutions together were the most developed and elaborate social and political “experiments” in modern history and both had “failed,” both were attempts to create social orders based on justice or (especially in the case of the French Revolution) reason that had collapsed into tyranny or chaos. The movements that destroyed (or attempted to destroy) absolutist monarchies were usually led by new elites (the rural or urban bourgeoisie: landowners, merchants, and ﬁnanciers) whose access to political power was blocked by the old386 MARXIST CRITICISM regime. In order to overthrow the old state and to create a system that more adequately represented their interests, the new elites were forced to mobilize the plebeian masses (peasants, workers, and the urban poor). But in doing so they found that they had conjured up a monster that, once unleashed, could not be controlled. It was widely felt, even by those sympathetic to such experiments, that the mass mobilizations necessary to destroy the old order effectively blocked the creation of the new. Unleashing the power of the multitude had led to anarchy, and to the proliferation of innumerable demands that went far beyond what was rational or even “just” (according to the norms of middle-class rev- olutionaries). The dreams of progress toward a rational state faded in the face of what appeared to be the unpredictable, seemingly “irra- tional” character of the activity of the masses. The Enlightenment, far from having led to the reign of reason, had unloosed elemental forces deaf to the appeals of the morality that had liberated them in the ﬁrst place. Accordingly, a general demoralization followed the close of the French Revolution, creating an atmosphere in which the Enlighten- ment was called radically into question and with it the notion of history conceived as progress toward a world organized on the basis of reason. And the close of the French Revolution did little to resolve this dilemma. Instead, it was displaced to England which, following the Napoleonic wars, itself entered a period of social crisis the character of which only further underscored these questions. According to historian E. P. Thompson, “it is as if the English nation entered a crucible in the 1790s and emerged after the wars in a different form” (191). This cru- cible, often referred to as the industrial revolution, was anything but a period of smooth evolution. First, the era was marked by the sudden emergence of new technologies whose origins seemed inexplicable to contemporaries, appearing to herald a world utterly unlike what had gone before. As a contemporary commentator, Cooke Taylor, noted in 1843: “steam engine had no precedent and the spinning-jenny is with- out ancestry . . . they sprang into sudden existence like Minerva from the brain of Iupiter” (qtd. in Thompson 190). Before the paradox of technologies created by human beings but whose nature seemed to defy human understanding, the mind sought refuge in the familiar lan- guage of mystery and miracle. But these new technologies and the industrial systems they made possible were perhaps less disturbing than their effects on the lives of the laboring population. Increased unemployment, falling wages, rising prices for food and other necessities: these were the conditions thatWARREN MONTAG 387 grew alongside the prosperity of the employing class. This contradic- tory development of capitalism meant that the peace and social har- mony associated with a rural economy had been replaced by the apparently insurmountable conﬂict of the industrial order: “the cotton- mill is seen as the agent not only of industrial but also social revolution, producing not only more goods but also the labor movement itself ” (Thompson 192). For Thompson, “the outstanding fact of the period between 1790 and 1830 is the formation of ‘the working class’ ” (194), a social force conscious of its own interests as opposed to the interests of the dominant classes that began to act on the basis of these interests. The English working class had entered the political stage, but in forms that could only appear monstrous to contemporary observers. The ﬁrst wave of this movement, from 181 1 to 1813, consisted of the mass action of workers bent on resisting the introduction of new tech- nologies, particularly into the textile industry. By reducing the numbers ofworkers necessary to the production process, new industrial develop- ments added to what was already a crisis of unemployment. This move- ment amounted to a clandestine army under the command of the mythical General Ludd (in fact no such leader existed). The “Luddites” sacked factories and smashed the new “labor saving machines.” As their movement receded in the face of violent repression on the part of the British state, it was quickly succeeded by a wave of popular agitation against high prices and rents. Mass demonstrations were common, vio- lent confrontations with the state only slightly less so. It was a time when talk of the threat or hope of revolution (according to one’s per- spective) was common. At the very moment that Frankenstein was ﬁrst published, the British state suspended various civil rights (including that of habeas corpus) in order more effectively to counter the growing combativity of the unemployed and the working poor. Mary Shelley’s work is incontestably interwoven in this history: it bears witness to the birth of that monster, simultaneously the object of pity and fear, the industrial working class (Moretti). A dense network of resemblances appears to allow us to identify Frankenstein’s monster with the emergent proletariat. The monster is monstrous by virtue of its being artiﬁcial rather than natural; lacking the unity of a natural organ- ism, the monster is a factitious totality assembled from (the parts of) a multitude of different individuals (Goldner), in particular, the “poor,” the urban mass that, because it is a multitude rather than an individual, is itself as nameless as Frankenstein’s creation. It is also signiﬁcant that the term creation is used at all to describe the origins of the monster. 1-" 4|-Lid. _. I;-_-.-_.'__.i||we .. -....._ -. . _ _....388 MARXIST CRITICISM For the monster is a product rather than a creation, assembled and joined together not so much by a man (if such were the case the mon- ster might be allotted a place in the order of things) as by science, tech- nology, and industry (Lecourt), whose overarching logic subsumes and subjects even the greatest geniuses. In fact, Frankenstein the man struggles against Frankenstein the practitioner of science and servant of technological progress only ﬁnally to prove no more than an unwitting instrument of this progress. In this way the very notion of progress, a central ideological representation of the perpetual revolutionizing of the means by which goods are produced necessary to the develop- ment of capitalism, becomes problematic. Technological and industrial progress has produced a monster, an artiﬁcial being as destructive as it is powerful. The very logic of capitalism has produced the means of its own destruction: the industrial working class, that fabricated collectiv- ity whose interests are irreconcilable with those of capital and which is thus rendered monstrous in the eyes of its creators. The development of capitalism, then, does not correspond to a logic at all, except perhaps a dialectical logic capable of grasping the manner in which the produc- tion of wealth engenders terrible poverty, and in which the greater the . intelligence of the machine the more stunted the mind of the worker. But of course, Mary Shelley is not content to denounce the “hideous progeny” (p. 25) of the ﬁrst phase of industrial capitalism. For the monster is no less contradictory than the process that created it. Far from being simply the object of horror, the monster, so eloquent in describing his suffering and solitude, also elicits pity, if not exactly sym- pathy. Shelley thus lends her voice to the voiceless, those who, bowed and numbed by oppression and poverty, cannot speak for themselves. The same ambivalence, the same combination of pity and fear is to be found in “The Mask of Anarchy,” a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley for which Mary Shelley wrote an explanatory note. The poem, written in response to the Peterloo massacre of 1819, describes the “slavery” of the “men of England.” Starvation, poverty, injustice, and the violence of the ruling class and its state will cause the masses to “Feel revenge / Fiercely thirsting to exchange / Blood for blood — and wrong for wrong.” Shelley concludes the stanza with the admonition “Do not thus when ye are strong.” Sympathy circumscribed by fear, ﬁnally con- ditional, an appeal to reason and law that is unconvincing even in the poem’s own terms, “The Mask of Anarchy” with its refrain, “ye are many — they are few,” fears nothing so much as the ever present possi- bility of the irrational (although objectively determined) violence of the “sleeping giant,” the British working class, and a repetition of the Ter-WARREN MONTAG 389 ror of the French Revolution. Is not Frankenstein this very dilemma presented as a fable? Considered in this way, the work assumes a kind of coherence that in turn derives from the “class location” of the author. Frankenstein seems to center on the emergence of the industrial working class as a political and social force, seen in the light of the French and perhaps even British revolutions by the “progressive” artist: unable ﬁnally to identify with the proletariat and to adopt its point of view, even the rad- icals of Mary Shelley’s milieu are constrained to regard it as a monster. If Marxist criticism worked this way it would resemble a kind of decod- ing. The critic replaces the apparent with the real and the mythological with the historical: the monster is the proletariat. History disguised as the novel remains only to be unmasked by the reader. But such a reading is too simple; to stop here would be to reduce the literary work to a mere allegory structured by a set of symbolic equivalences: the monster equals the proletariat. Conceived in this way the work remains outside history, which is alluded to even as it is con- cealed. But a Marxist reading demands a more complex conception of the work, for Marxism is above all a materialism. All that exists, includ- ing art and culture, necessarily possesses a material existence. From a materialist point of view, the literary work cannot somehow exist out- side of history and even less outside of reality. It cannot be collapsed into or reduced to something “more real” than itself, that is history. When we say that literary works are historical by their very nature we mean that history is as present in them as outside of them, that we do not leave the work in search of its historical meaning but seek the mean- ing of its historical existence within it. For Marxism, history is a struggle between antagonistic social forces. Further, this struggle is inescapable: it is present in every cultural artifact, every intellectual enterprise. But the struggle is not the same throughout history, it takes many forms and involves many actors. It follows no rules and obeys no logic. Literary works are not simply ex- pressions of some invariable, essential contradiction; they are singular, speciﬁc realizations of a struggle whose character is perpetually trans- formed by its own activity. Thus, if we are to seek the signs of the historicity of the work within it, this historicity will inescapably be present in the form of a conﬂict. This conﬂict, however, is not merely or even primarily present in the content of the work, but rather in the very letter of the text. While liter- ary works have, since Aristotle, been deﬁned by their coherence, by390 MARXIST CRITICISM their formal resolution of internal contradictions and antagonism, Marxism asks us to understand them on the basis of the speciﬁc con- ﬂicts that have generated them and that every work, no matter how apparently coherent, embodies and perhaps transforms but cannot resolve. Most often these contradictions are not what the work is about at all; instead they constitute symptomatic antagonisms that disrupt the unity that the text appears to display. From a Marxist point of view, an adequate reading of Frankenstein will therefore refrain from the enter- prise of establishing correspondences between the apparently parallel worlds of literature and history and will instead seek to grasp the way in which history is present in the text as a force or motor (“class struggle is the motor of history,” as Marx and Engels wrote in The Communist Manifesto). History sets the work against itself and splits it open, forc- ing it to reveal all that it sought to deny but cannot help revealing by the very fact of this denial. We will begin by posing the question the answer to which we have already begun to formulate: What are the con- tradictions, discrepancies, and inconsistencies that the work displays but does not address or attempt to resolve? This question brings us immediately into conﬂict with the form of the work. For Frankenstein’s life, at least as he narrates it from his deathbed, possesses an absolute coherence. His every thought, word, and deed are revealed to have been steps toward a destiny that awaited him from the beginning. He is able to see that he has always lived according to laws of whose existence he had been unaware, seeking without knowing it an end that would mean his destruction: “Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and ter- rible destruction” (p. 49). But his destiny is neither personal nor individual: Frankenstein has been the instrument of science. A seemingly chance encounter with the works of Cornelius Agrippa, his father’s too casual dismissal of Agrippa, the reduction of a tree to splinters by lightning, the decision to attend the University of Ingolstadt: each of these moments was a ruse of scien- tiﬁc and technological progress, realizing itself through him but with- out his knowing it. His life as it is narrated assumes a nightmarish coherence; every experience, sensation, and feeling was a step on the road to his damnation. Although he once dreamed of creating a race that would worship him as master, he realizes as he lies dying that his relation to science ought rather to be described as a state of servitude. The ironic reversal of Frankenstein’s position is perhaps clearest when his creation, far more powerful than he, calls him “slave.”WARREN MONTAG 391 Irony is natural to this dialectic of science, the essence of which is as manifest in violence as in peace, in destruction as in creation. Indiffer- ent to human law and morality, science ﬁnally counterposes its own order to that of humankind. Frankenstein thus rejects one of the most fundamental myths of the Enlightenment, the notion that scientiﬁc and economic progress will continually improve the condition of humankind, the idea that once the barriers to knowledge are pushed aside, the conditions for perpetual peace and a universal harmony will have been established. Once we have stepped away from the false sup- ports, the dogmas and formulas that prevented us f'om thinking on our own, once we have taken as our creed the Kantian motto sapere aude, “dare to know” (Kant), we will not have achieved the freedom we dreamed of but merely a new kind of servitude. For knowledge has a logic of its own, within which humankind may play only an instrumen- tal role. There is no longer any such thing as progress in the singular; there is a plurality of progresses, some antithetical to others. No longer does the progress of science and, by extension, reason necessarily entail an improvement of the human condition. Scientiﬁc and technological progress does not strengthen human institutions by reafﬁrming the community of free and rational individuals but instead introduces sepa- rateness, division, and antagonism into the social world. From the moment Frankenstein surrenders to the “enticements of science” (p. 55) he is irrevocably divided from his family and friends. Even the University of Ingolstadt fails to provide anything like an academic com- munity. It is a world of separate, solitary scientists. Krempe and Wald- man seem scarcely to know each other. Upon entering the portals of science, Frankenstein experiences a solitude matched only by that of his creation. The monster in its turn is not so much the creation that Franken- stein constantly calls it, as a product, the product of reason. In fact, the frequent recourse to theological terminology (which places Franken- stein in the position of a tragic god who is the prisoner of providence) may once again be regarded as a symptom: it masks the extent to which Frankenstein has himself been created, hailed into existence in order to hasten the realization of a reason whose ends are unknowable to him. Reason is always in the process of becoming real and its realization may well involve the production of monsters or a displacing of the human by the inhuman. For in the process, which in its largest sense is nothing other than history itself, humankind is in no way central. Humanity’s greatest achievement may have been to hasten its own destruction.392 MARXIST CRITICISM Frankenstein has thus been led inescapably to the threshold repre- sented by “the workshop of ﬁlthy creation”: In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of ﬁlthy creation: my eye-balls were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion. (pp. 58-59) The narrative pauses at this threshold; the reader is not conducted into the “workshop.” At this point the narrative digresses into moral com- mentary until Frankenstein uncharacteristically refers to the presence of Walton, his listener: “your looks remind me to proceed.” But his narra- tive does not begin again from where it left off. Instead it begins with his work completed: “It was on a dreary night of November, that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils” (p. 60). Utterly absent from the narrative is any description or explanation of the process by which the monster was created. The sequences so central to the ﬁlm versions of Shelley’s tale, in which the mystery of technology is reafﬁrmed through iconic ﬁgures of electric arcs and bubbling chemicals, have no place at this point or any other of Mary Shelley’s narrative. The process of production is evoked but never described, effectively presenting us a world of effects without causes. In this sense, Victor’s capacity for denial, his ability to forget after the initial shock that his creation runs amok, resembles the movement of the text itself, which “turns away” at certain key points, omitting every description of the technology so cen- tral to the tragedy of Victor Frankenstein and his creation. In no sense can this omission be regarded as mistake or failure on Mary Shelley’s part. On the contrary, the omission recurs throughout the work with a regularity that renders it integral to the work as a whole. At the same time it should not be dismissed as an authorial choice, an intentional abbreviation of the narrative for the sake of brevity or coherence. For as was evident in the sequence described above, this omission appears as a gap in the narrative that is ﬁlled in or covered over by a digression that is marked as a deviation by the narrative itself. Technology and science, so central to the novel, are present only in their effects; their truth becomes visible only in the face of their hideous progeny and is written in the tragic lives of those who serve them.WARREN MONTAG 393 If we now return to the passage above, we may see the way in which the systematic suppression of the scientiﬁc and the technological func- tions at an even more primary level. The passage begins by evoking the solitary separateness of Frankenstein’s labor. He works in a “solitary chamber,” a term of description that is replaced by the apparently more accurate “cell.” The textual movement from chamber to cell is impor- tant. For if “cell” is a synonym for “solitary chamber,” it adds certain associations that link Frankenstein’s solitude to that of a monk in a monastery or a prisoner in prison. We understand the metaphor of the prison cell: Frankenstein has always been a prisoner, and perhaps most when he believed himself to be free (of familial and social obligations), forced to labor on a project of whose ultimate meaning he remained ignorant. Thus, shortly after this passage, he compares himself to “one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines” (p. 60). But the idea of a monk’s cell presents more difﬁculty insofar as it is incompatible with Frankenstein’s scientiﬁc activity. The kind of discov- eries made by monks in the closed world of their cells were precisely those of Cornelius Agrippa, the fantastic, exploded systems that were the empty creations of deluded minds. But his coupling of the religious and the scientiﬁc is far f'om unusual in the text as a whole. For just as the narrative cannot describe any scientiﬁc activity, so it cannot speak of the scientiﬁc without ﬁrst clothing it in theological terms. The narra- tive thereby protects itself from the reality that it describes by casting a veil over that reality: it must continue to cover that which it reveals. In this way, the stark heterogeneity of the phrase “workshop of ﬁlthy creation” is placed clearly in relief. Here, the incompatible worlds of industry (workshop) and theology (creation) collide. The material activity associated with the workshop, the work of manufacture, is immediately supplanted by the immateriality of creation as the text itself turns with loathing from the images that it produces. Like the dissecting room and the slaughterhouse, the “details of his employ- ment” are too frightening to reproduce. As Victor speaks, his “eyes swim with the remembrance” (p. 58) and he frequently turns away from the reality of his own activity. Thus the technology so central to the Promethean drama is in one sense utterly absent from the work. If we have argued that this absence is neither a fault for which the author might be reproached (for example, Mary Shelley was ignorant of scientiﬁc procedure and the technologies of her time) nor simply a styl- istic choice (for example, the descriptions are in no way “essential” to the narrative and would at best be superﬂuous) but highly sympto- matic, it is not simply because the narrative “stumbles” and digresses at394 MARXIST CRITICISM the threshold of the “workshop of ﬁlthy creation.” For this absence is doubled by another: the world that this “modern Prometheus” inhabits is not modern at all. Frankenstein’s world is a world without industry, a rural world dominated by scenes of a sublime natural beauty in which not a single trace of Blake’s “dark satanic mills” is to be found. Although Frankenstein is reared in Geneva and educated at Inglostadt, although he and Clerval visit London, Oxford, and Edinburgh, there are no signiﬁcant descriptions of the urban world, none certainly to match the frequent portraits of natural vistas and rural scenes. London, at a time of explosive growth and development (cf. Wordsworth’s treat- ment of London in the Prelude), is not described at all although he and Clerval passed “some months” there (p. 139). Further, there are no workers or work. The peasants who appear intermittently throughout the novel are either engaged in various forms of recreation or, as turns out to be the case with the De Lacey family, they are not peasants at all. The effect of this suppression of the urban and the industrial is to render Frankenstein’s labor as well as the product of that labor, the monster, all the more incongruous. He is the sole embodiment of the industrial in an otherwise rural world, and this is the source of his mon- strousness. At one point, the monster makes explicit his identiﬁcation with the working class: I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow- creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with only one of these advantages; but, without either, he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the proﬁts of the chosen few! And what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant; but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. . . . When I looked around, I saw and heard of none like me. Was I then a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men ﬂed, and whom all men disowned? (p. 109) It is at this point that we see most clearly the associations that link the image of the monster to the industrial proletariat: an unnatural being, singular even in its collective identity, without a genealogy and belonging to no species. Its tragic fate is all the more pitiable in that it is necessary and, in the grand scheme of things, just and proper. If the proletariat speaks (like the monster always through an intermediary), the reader, like Frankenstein and Walton, must resist its eloquence: “hear him not” (p. 178). At the same time, however, Frankenstein’sWARREN MONTAG 395 monster is ﬁnally not identiﬁed with the working class of Mary Shelley’s time but with its absence. For the narrative precisely suppresses all that is modern in order to render this being inexplicable and unprece- dented, a being for whom there is no place in the ordered world of nature. If the modern (the urban, the industrial, the proletarian) were allowed to appear, the monster would no longer be a monster; no longer alone but part of a “race of devils,” his disappearance would change nothing. Instead, the mass is reduced to the absolute singularity of Frankenstein’s creation, which is therefore not so much the sign of the proletariat as of its unrepresentability. Written before the notion of a postcapitalist order (a society ruled by the workers themselves) could be articulated but at a time when the oppressive and dehumanizing effects of capitalism were all too obvious, the work can do no better than to turn backward toward a time of mu- tual (if unequal) obligation, to a time before the creation of monsters by the industrial order, a time when the human was regulated by the natural. But if a certain historical reality is inscribed within the work as a monster to be expelled into “darkness and distance” (just as Franken- stein himself “forgets” his “hideous progeny” immediately after bring- ing it into this world), the act of repression can only postpone its inevitable return.

A performance of a Mozart symphony at Lincoln Center or a Rem- brandt show at the De Young Museum in San Francisco? Does the phrase “cultural event” conjure up images of young people in jeans and T-shirts — or of people in their sixties dressed formally? Most people hear “culture” and think “high culture.” Consequently, when they ﬁrst hear of cultural criticism, most people assume it is more formal than, well, say, formalism. They suspect it is “highbrow,” in both subject and style. Nothing could be further from the truth. Cultural critics oppose the view that culture refers exclusively to high culture, Culture with a capital C. Cultural critics want to make the term refer to popular, folk, urban, and mass (mass-produced, -disseminated, -mediated, and -consumed) culture, as well as to that culture we associate with the so- called classics. Raymond Williams, an early British cultural critic whose ideas will later be described at greater length, suggested that “art and culture are ordinary”; he did so not to “pull art down” but rather to point out that there is “creativity in all our living. . . . We create our human world as we have thought of art being created” (Revolution 37). 396WHAT IS CULTURAL CRITICISM? 397 Cultural critics have consequently placed a great deal of emphasis on what Michel de Certeau has called “the practice of everyday life.” Rather than approaching literature in the elitist way that academic liter- ary critics have traditionally approached it, cultural critics view it more as an anthropologist would. They ask how it emerges from and com- petes with other forms of discourse within a given culture (science, for instance, or television). They seek to understand the social contexts in which a given text was written, and under what conditions it was — and is — produced, disseminated, read, and used. Contemporary cultural critics are as willing to write about Star Trek as they are to analyze Iames Ioyce’s Ulysses, a modern literary classic full of allusions to Homer’s Odyssey. And when they write about Ulysses, they are likely to view it as a collage reﬂecting and representing cultural forms common to Ioyce’s Dublin, such as advertising, journalism, ﬁlm, and pub life. Cultural critics typically show how the boundary we tend to envision between high and low forms of culture — forms thought of as important on one hand and relatively trivial on the other — is trans- gressed in all sorts of exciting ways within works on both sides of the putative cultural divide. A cultural critic writing about a revered classic might contrast it with a movie, or even a comic-strip version produced during a later period. Alternatively, the literary classic might be seen in a variety of other ways: in light of some more common form of reading material (a novel by Iane Austen might be viewed in light of Gothic romances or ladies’ conduct manuals); as the reﬂection of some common cultural myths or concerns (Adventures of Huckleberry Finn might be shown to reﬂect and shape American myths about race and concerns about juve- nile delinquency); or as an example of how texts move back and forth across the alleged boundary between “low” and “high” culture. For instance, one group of cultural critics has pointed out that although Shakespeare’s history plays probably started off as popular works enjoyed by working people, they were later considered “highbrow” plays that only the privileged and educated could appreciate. That view of them changed, however, due to later ﬁlm productions geared toward a national audience. A ﬁlm version of Henry Vproduced during World War II, for example, made a powerful, popular, patriotic statement about England’s greatness during wartime (Humm, Stigant, and Wid- dowson 6-7). More recently, cultural critics have analyzed the “cul- tural work” accomplished cooperatively by Shakespeare and Kenneth Branagh in the latter’s 1992 ﬁlm production of Henry V398 CULTURAL CRITICISM In combating old deﬁnitions of what constitutes culture, of course, cultural critics sometimes end up contesting old deﬁnitions of what constitutes the literary canon, that is, the once-agreed-upon honor roll of Great Books. They tend to do so, however, neither by adding books (and movies and television sitcoms) to the old list of texts that every “culturally literate” person should supposedly know nor by substituting some kind of counterculture canon. Instead, they tend to critique the very idea of canon. Cultural critics want to get us away from thinking about certain works as the “best” ones produced by a given culture They seek to be more descriptive and less evaluative, more interested in relating than in rating cultural products and events. They also aim to discover the (often political) reasons why a certain kind of aesthetic or cultural prod- uct is more valued than others. This is particularly true when the prod- uct in question is one produced since 1945, for most cultural critics follow Iean Baudrillard (Simulations, 1981) and Andreas Huyssen (The Great Divide, 1986) in thinking that any distinctions that may once have existed between high, popular, and mass culture collapsed after the end of World War II. Their discoveries have led them beyond the literary canon, prompting them to interrogate many other value hierar- chies. For instance, Pierre Bourdieu in Distinction: A Social Critique of the ]udgment of Taste (1984 [1979]) and Dick Hebdige in Hiding the Light: On Images and Things (1988) have argued that deﬁnitions of “good taste”— which are instrumental in fostering and reinforcing cul- tural discrimination — tell us at least as much about prevailing social, economic, and political conditions as they do about artistic quality and value. In an article entitled “The Need for Cultural Studies,” four groundbreaking cultural critics have written that “Cultural Studies should . . . abandon the goal of giving students access to that which represents a culture.” A literary work, they go on to suggest, should be seen in relation to other works, to economic conditions, or to broad social discourses (about childbirth, women’s education, rural decay, and so on) within whose contexts it makes sense. Perhaps most impor- tant, critics practicing cultural studies should counter the prevalent notion of culture as some preformed whole. Rather than being static or monolithic, culture is really a set of interactive cultures, alive and chang- ing, and cultural critics should be present- and even future-oriented. They should be “resisting intellectuals,” and cultural studies should be “an emancipatory project” (Giroux et al. 478-80).WHAT IS CULTURAL CRITICISM? 399 The paragraphs above are peppered with words like oppose, counter, deny, resist, combat, abandon, and emancipatory. What such words quite accurately suggest is that a number of cultural critics view themselves in political, even oppositional, terms. Not only are they likely to take on the literary canon, they are also likely to oppose the institution of the university, for that is where the old deﬁnitions of culture as high culture (and as something formed, ﬁnished, and canonized) have been most vigorously preserved, defended, and reinforced. Cultural critics have been especially critical of the departmental structure of universities, which, perhaps more than anything else, has kept the study of the “arts” relatively distinct from the study of history, not to mention from the study of such things as television, ﬁlm, adver- tising, journalism, popular photography, folklore, current affairs, shop- talk, and gossip. By maintaining artiﬁcial boundaries, universities have tended to reassert the high/low culture distinction, implying that all the latter subjects are best left to historians, sociologists, anthropolo- gists, and communication theorists. Cultural critics have taken issue with this implication, arguing that the way of thinking reinforced by the departmentalized structure of universities keeps us from seeing the aes- thetics of an advertisement as well as the propagandistic elements of a work of literature. Cultural critics have consequently mixed and matched the analytical procedures developed in a variety of disciplines. They have formed — and encouraged other scholars to form — net- works and centers, often outside of those enforced departmentally. Some initially loose interdisciplinary networks have, over time, solidiﬁed to become cultural studies programs and majors. As this has happened, a signiﬁcant if subtle danger has arisen. Richard Iohnson, who along with Hebdige, Stuart Hall, and Richard Hoggart was instru- mental in developing the Center for Contemporary Cultural Studies at Birmingham University in England, has warned that cultural studies must not be allowed to turn into yet another traditional academic disci- pline — one in which students encounter a canon replete with soap operas and cartoons, one in which belief in the importance of such pop- ular forms has become an “orthodoxy” (39). The only principles that critics doing cultural studies can doctrinally espouse, Iohnson suggests, are the two that have thus far been introduced: the principle that “culture” has been an “inegalitarian” concept, a “tool” of “condescen- sion,” and the belief that a new, “interdisciplinary (and even antidisci- plinary)” approach to true culture (that is, to the forms in which culture currently lives) is required now that history, art, and the com- munications media are so complex and interrelated (42).400 CULTURAL CRITICISM The object of cultural study should not be a body of works assumed to comprise or reﬂect a given culture. Rather, it should be human con- sciousness, and the goal of that critical analysis should be to understand and show how that consciousness is itself forged and formed, to a great extent, by cultural forces. “Subjectivities,” as Iohnson has put it, are “produced, not given, and are . . . objects of inquiry” inewtably related to “social practices,” whether those involve factory rules, supermarket behavior patterns, reading habits, advertisements, myths, or languages and other signs to which people are exposed (44-45). Although the United States has probably contributed more than any other nation to the media through which culture is currently expressed, and although many if not most contemporary practitioners of cultural criticism are North American, the evolution of cultural criti- cism and, more broadly, cultural studies has to a great extent been inﬂu- enced by theories developed in Great Britain and on the European continent. Among the Continental thinkers whose work allowed for the devel- opment of cultural studies are those whose writings we associate with structuralism and poststructuralism. Using the linguistic theory of Fer- dinand de Saussure, structuralists suggested that the structures of lan- guage lie behind all human organization. They attempted to create a semiology— a science of signs — that would give humankind at once a scientiﬁc and holistic way of studying the world and its human inhabi- tants. Roland Barthes, a structuralist who later shifted toward post- structuralism, attempted to recover literary language from the isolation in which it had been studied and to show that the laws that govern it govern all signs, from road signs to articles of clothing. Claude Lévi- Strauss, an anthropologist who studied the structures of everything from cuisine to villages to myths, looked for and found recurring, com- mon elements that transcended the differences within and between cultures. Of the structuralist and poststructuralist thinkers who have had an impact on the evolution of cultural studies, Iacques Lacan is one of three whose work has been particularly inﬂuential. A structuralist psy- choanalytic theorist, Lacan posited that the human unconscious is structured like a language and treated dreams not as revealing symp- toms of repression but, rather, as forms of discourse. Lacan also argued that the ego, subject, or self that we think of as being natural (our individual human nature) is in fact a product of the social order and its symbolic systems (especially, but not exclusively, language). Lacan’sWHAT IS CULTURAL CRITICISM? 401 thought has served as the theoretical underpinning for cultural critics seeking to show the way in which subjectivities are produced by social discourses and practices. Iacques Derrida, a French philosopher whose name has become synonymous with poststructuralism, has had an inﬂuence on cultural criticism at least as great as that of Lacan. The linguistic focus of struc- _ turalist thought has by no means been abandoned by poststructuralists, despite their opposition to structuralism’s tendency to ﬁnd universal patterns instead of textual and cultural contradictions. Indeed, Derrida has provocatively asserted that “there is nothing outside the text” (Gram- matology 158), by which he means something like the following: we come to know the world through language, and even our most worldly actions and practices (the Gulf War, the wearing of condoms) are dependent upon discourses (even if they deliberately contravene those discourses). Derrida’s “deconstruction” of the world/text distinction, like his deconstruction of so many of the hierarchical oppositions we habitually use to interpret and evaluate reality, has allowed cultural crit- ics to erase the boundaries between high and low culture, classic and popular literary texts, and literature and other cultural discourses that, following Derrida, may be seen as manifestations of the same textuality. Michel Foucault is the third Continental thinker associated with structuralism and/ or poststructuralism who has had a particularly pow- erful impact on the evolution of cultural studies — and perhaps the strongest inﬂuence on American cultural criticism and the so-called new historicism, an interdisciplinary form of cultural criticism whose evolution has often paralleled that of cultural criticism. Although Fou- cault broke with Marxism after the French student uprisings of 1968, he was inﬂuenced enough by Marxist thought to study cultures in terms of power relationships. Unlike Marxists, however, Foucault refused to see power as something exercised by a dominant class over a subservient class. Indeed, he emphasized that power is not just repres- sive power, that is, a tool of conspiracy by one individual or institution against another. Power, rather, is a whole complex of forces; it is that which produces what happens. Thus even a tyrannical aristocrat does not simply wield power but is empowered by “discourses”— accepted ways of thinking, writing, and speaking — and practices that embody, exercise, and amount to power. Foucault tried to view all things, from punishment to sexuality, in terms of the widest possible variety of discourses. As a result, he traced what he called the “genealogy” of topics he studied through texts that more traditional historians and literary critics would have overlooked,402 CULTURAL CRITICISM examining (in Lynn Hunt’s words) “memoirs of deviants, diaries, polit- ical treatises, architectural blueprints, court records, doctors’ reports — appl[ying] consistent principles of analysis in search of moments of reversal in discourse, in search of events as loci of the conﬂict where social practices were transformed” (Hunt 39). Foucault tended not only to build interdisciplinary bridges but also, in the process, to bring into the study of culture the “histories of women, homosexuals, and minorities”— groups seldom studied by those interested in Culture with a capital C (Hunt 45). Of the British inﬂuences on cultural studies and criticism, two stand out prominently. One, the Marxist historian E. P. Thompson, revolu- tionized the study of the industrial revolution by writing about its impact on human attitudes, even consciousness. He showed how a shared cultural view, speciﬁcally that of what constitutes a fair or just price, inﬂuenced crowd behavior and caused such things as the “food riots” of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (during which the women of Nottingham repriced breads in the shops of local bakers, paid for the goods they needed, and carried them away). The other, even more important early British inﬂuence on contemporary cultural criticism and cultural studies was Raymond Williams, who coined the phrase “culture is ordinary.” In works like Culture and Society: 1780- 1950 (1958) and The Long Revolution (1961) Williams demonstrated that culture is not ﬁxed and ﬁnished but, rather, living and evolving. One of the changes he called for was the development of a common socialist culture. Although Williams dissociated himself from Marxism during the period 1945-58, he always followed the Marxist practice of viewing culture in relation to ideologies, which he deﬁned as the “residual,” “dominant,” or “emerging” ways of viewing the world held by classes or individual holding power in a given social group. He avoided dwelling on class conﬂict and class oppression, however, tending instead to focus on people as people, on how they experience the condi- tions in which they ﬁnd themselves and creatively respond to those con- ditions through their social practices. A believer in the resiliency of the individual, Williams produced a body of criticism notable for what Stu- art Hall has called its “humanism” (63). As is clearly suggested in several of the preceding paragraphs, Marx- ism is the background to the background of cultural criticism. What isn’t as clear is that some contemporary cultural critics consider them- selves Marxist critics as well. It is important, therefore, to have someWHAT IS CULTURAL CRITICISM? 403 familiarity with certain Marxist concepts — those that would have been familiar to Foucault, Thompson, and Williams, plus those espoused by contemporary cultural critics who self-identify with Marxism. That familiarity can be gained from an introduction to the works of four important Marxist thinkers: Mikhail Bakhtin, Walter Benjamin, Anto- nio Gramsci, and Louis Althusser. Bakhtin was a Russian, later a Soviet, critic so original in his think- ing and wide-ranging in his inﬂuence that some would say he was never a Marxist at all. He viewed literary works in terms of discourses and dia- logues between discourses. The narrative of a novel written in a society in ﬂux, for instance, may include an ofﬁcial, legitimate discourse, plus others that challenge its viewpoint and even its authority. In a 1929 book on Dostoyevsky and the 1940 study Rabelais and His World, Bakhtin examined what he calls “polyphonic” novels, each character- ized by a multiplicity of voices or discourses. In Dostoyevsky the inde- pendent status of a given character is marked by the difference of his or her language from that of the narrator. (The narrator’s language may itself involve a dialogue between opposed points of view.) In works by Rabelais, Bakhtin ﬁnds that the (profane) languages of Carnival and of other popular festivities play against and parody the more ofﬁcial dis- courses of the magistrates and the church. Bakhtin’s relevance to cul- tural criticism lies in his suggestion that the dialogue involving high and low culture takes place not only between classic and popular texts but also between the “dialogic” voices that exist within all great books. Walter Benjamin was a German Marxist who, during roughly the same period, attacked fascism and questioned the superior value placed on certain traditional literary forms that he felt conveyed a stultifying “aura” of culture. He took this position in part because so many previ- ous Marxist critics (and, in his own day, Georg Lukacs) had seemed to prefer nineteenth-century realistic novels to the modernist works of their own time. Benjamin not only praised modernist movements, such as dadaism, but also saw as promising the development of new art forms utilizing mechanical production and reproduction. These forms, in- cluding photography, radio, and ﬁlm, promised that the arts would become a more democratic, less exclusive, domain. Anticipating by decades the work of those cultural critics interested in mass-produced, mass-mediated, and mass-consumed culture, Benjamin analyzed the meanings and (defensive) motivations behind words like unique and authentic when used in conjunction with mechanically reproduced art. Antonio Gramsci, an Italian Marxist best known for his Prison Note- books (ﬁrst published in 1947), critiqued the very concept of literature404 CULTURAL CRITICISM and, beyond that, of culture in the old sense, stressing the importance of culture more broadly deﬁned and the need for nurturing and devel- oping proletarian, or working-class, culture. He argued that all intellec- tual or cultural work is fundamentally political and expressed the need for what he called “radical organic” intellectuals. Today’s cultural critics urging colleagues to “legitimate the notion of writing reviews and books for the general public,” to “become involved in the political reading of popular culture,” and more generally to “repoliticize” schol- arship have viewed Gramsci as an early precursor (Giroux et al. 482). Gramsci related literature to the ideologies — the prevailing ideas, beliefs, values, and prejudices — of the culture in which it was pro- duced. He developed the concept of “hegemony,” which refers at once to the process of consensus-formation and to the authority of the ide- ologies so formed, that is to say, their power to shape the way things look, what they would seem to mean, and, therefore, what reality is for the majority of people. But Gramsci did not see people, even poor people, as the helpless victims of hegemony, as ideology’s pathetic robots. Rather, he believed that people have the freedom and power to struggle against and shape ideology, to alter hegemony, to break out of the weblike system of prevailing assumptions and to form a new con- sensus. As Patrick Brantlinger has suggested in Crusoe’s Footprints: Cul- tural Studies in Britain and America (1990), Gramsci rejected the “intellectual arrogance that views the vast majority of people as deluded zombies, the victims or creatures of ideology” (100). Of those Marxists who, after Gramsci, explored the complex rela- tionship between literature and ideology, the French Marxist Louis Althusser had a signiﬁcant impact on cultural criticism. Unlike Gramsci, Althusser tended to portray ideology as being in control of people, and not vice versa. He argued that the main function of ideology is to reproduce the society’s existing relations of production, and that that function is even carried out in literary texts. In many ways, though, Althusser is as good an example of how Marxism and cultural criticism part company as he is of how cultural criticism is indebted to Marxists and their ideas. For although Althusser did argue that literature is rela- tively autonomous — more independent of ideology than, say, church, press, or state — he meant literature in the high cultural sense, certainly not the variety of works that present-day cultural critics routinely exam- ine alongside those ofTolstoy and Ioyce, Eliot and Brecht. Popular ﬁc- tions, Althusser assumed, were mere packhorses designed (however unconsciously) to carry the baggage of a culture’s ideology, or mere brood mares destined to reproduce it.WHAT IS CULTURAL CRITICISM? 405 Thus, while a number of cultural critics would agree both with Althusser’s notion that works of literature reﬂect certain ideological formations and with his notion that, at the same time, literary works may be relatively distant from or even resistant to ideology, they have rejected the narrow limits within which Althusser and some other Marxists (such as Georg Lukacs) have deﬁned literature. In “Marxism and Popular Fiction” (1986), Tony Bennett uses Monty Python’s Flying Circus and another British television show, Not the 9 o’clock News, to argue that the Althusserian notion that all forms of culture belong “among [all those] many material forms which ideology takes. .. under capitalism” is “simply not true.” The “entire ﬁeld” of “popular ﬁction”— which Bennett takes to include ﬁlms and television shows as well as books — is said to be “replete with instances” of works that do what Bennett calls the “work” of “distancing.” That is, they have the effect of separating the audience from, not rebinding the audience to, prevailing ideologies (249). Although Marxist cultural critics exist (Bennett himself is one, car- rying on through his writings what may be described as a lovers’ quarrel with Marxism), most cultural critics are not Marxists in any strict sense. Anne Beezer, in writing about such things as advertisements and women’s magazines, contests the “Althusserian view of ideology as the construction of the subject” (qtd. in Punter 103). That is, she gives both the media she is concerned with and their audiences more credit than Althusserian Marxists presumably would. Whereas they might argue that such media make people what they are, she points out that the same magazines that, admittedly, tell women how to please their men may, at the same time, offer liberating advice to women about how to preserve their independence by not getting too serious romantically. And, she suggests, many advertisements advertise their status as ads, just as many people who view or read them see advertising as advertis- ing and interpret it accordingly. The complex sort of analysis that Beezer has brought to bear on women’s magazines and advertisements has been focused on paper- back romance novels by Tania Modleski and Ianice A. Radway in Loving with a Vengeance (1982) and Reading the Romance (1984), respectively. Radway, a feminist cultural critic who uses but ultimately goes beyond Marxism, points out that many women who read ro- mances do so in order to carve out a time and space that is wholly their own, not to be intruded upon by husbands or children. Although many such novels end in marriage, the marriage is usually between a feisty and406 CULTURAL CRITICISM independent heroine and a powerful man she has “tamed,” that is, made sensitive and caring. And why do so many of these stories involve such heroines and end as they do? Because, as Radway demonstrates through painstaking research into publishing houses, bookstores, and reading communities, their consumers want them to. They don’t buy — or, if they buy they don’t recommend — romances in which, for example, a heroine is raped: thus, in time, fewer and fewer such plots ﬁnd their way onto the racks by the supermarket checkout. Radway’s reading is typical of feminist cultural criticism in that it is political, but not exclusively about oppression. The subjectivities of women may be “produced” by romances — the thinking of romance readers may be governed by what is read — but the same women also govern, to a great extent, what gets written or produced, thus perform- ing “cultural wor ” of their own. Rather than seeing all forms of popular culture as manifestations of ideology, soon to be remanifested in the minds of victimized audiences, cultural critics tend to see a sometimes disheartening but always dynamic synergy between cultural forms and the culture’s consumers. Their observations have increasingly led to an analysis of consumerism, from a feminist but also from a more general point of view. This analysis owes a great deal to the work of de Certeau, Hall, and, especially, Hebdige, whose 1979 book Subculture: The Mean- ing of Style paved the way for critics like Iohn Fiske (Television Culture, 1987), Greil Marcus (Dead Elvis, 1991), and Rachel Bowlby (Shopping with Freud, 1993). These latter critics have analyzed everything from the resistance tactics employed by television audiences to the inﬂuence of consumers on rock music styles to the psychology of consumer choice. The overlap between feminist and cultural criticism is hardly sur- prising, especially given the recent evolution of feminism into various feminisms, some of which remain focused on “majority” women of European descent, others of which have focused instead on the lives and writings of minority women in Western culture and of women liv- ing in Third World (now preferably called postcolonial) societies. The culturalist analysis of value hierarchies within and between cultures has inevitably focused on categories that include class, race, national origin, gender, and sexualities; the terms of its critique have proved useful to contemporary feminists, many of whom differ from their predecessors insofar as they see woman not as a universal category but, rather, as one of several that play a role in identity- or subject-formation. The inﬂu- ence of cultural criticism (and, in some cases, Marxist class analysis) can be seen in the work of contemporary feminist critics such as GayatriWHAT IS CULTURAL CRITICISM? 407 Spivak, Trinh T. Minh-ha, and Gloria Anzaldua, each of whom has stressed that while all women are female, they are something less as well (such as working-class, lesbian, Native American, Muslim Pakistani) and that that something else must be taken into account when their writings are read and studied. The expansion of feminism and feminist literary criticism to include multicultural analysis, of course, parallels a transformation of education in general. On college campuses across North America, the ﬁeld of African-American studies has grown and ﬂourished. African-American critics have been inﬂuenced by and have contributed to the cultural approach by pointing out that the white cultural elite ofNorth America has tended to view the oral-musical traditions of African Americans (traditions that include jazz, the blues, sermons, and folktales) as enter- taining, but nonetheless inferior. Black writers, in order not to be simi- larly marginalized, have produced texts that, as Henry Louis Gates has pointed out, fuse the language and traditions of the white Western canon with a black vernacular and traditions derived from African and Caribbean cultures. The resulting “hybridity” (to use Homi K. Bhabha’s word), although deplored by a handful of black separatist crit- ics, has proved both rich and complex — fertile ground for many cul- tural critics practicing Aﬁican-American criticism. Interest in race and ethnicity at home has gone hand in hand with a new, interdisciplinary focus on colonial and postcolonial societies abroad, in which issues of race, class, and ethnicity also loom large. Edward Said’s book Orientalism (1978) is generally said to have inau- gurated postcolonial studies, which in Bhabha’s words “bears witness to the unequal and uneven forces of cultural representation involved in the contest for political and social authority within the modern world order” (“Postcolonial Criticism” 437). Orientalism showed how East- ern and Middle Eastern peoples have for centuries been systematically stereotyped by the West, and how that stereotyping facilitated the colo- nization ofvast areas of the East and Middle East by Westerners. Said’s more recent books, along with postcolonial studies by Bhabha and Patrick Brantlinger, are among the most widely read and discussed works of literary scholarship. Brantlinger focuses on British literature of the Victorian period, examining representations of the colonies in works written during an era of imperialist expansion. Bhabha comple- ments Brantlinger by suggesting that modern Western culture is best understood from the postcolonial perspective. Thanks to the work of scholars like Brantlinger, Bhabha, Said, Gates, Anzaldua, and Spivak, education in general and literary study in408 CULTURAL CRITICISM particular is becoming more democratic, decentered (less patriarchal and Eurocentric), and multicultural. The future of literary criticism will owe a great deal indeed to those early cultural critics who demonstrated that the boundaries between high and low culture are at once repressive and permeable, that culture is common and therefore includes all forms of popular culture, that cultural deﬁnitions are inevitably political, and that the world we see is seen through society’s ideology. In a very real sense, the future of education is cultural studies. In the essay that follows, cultural critic Bouriana Zakharieva dis- cusses Kenneth Branagh’s 1994 ﬁlm Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein not in terms of its “aesthetic quality” but, rather, as a “symptom” of the “cul- tural climate” of the decade in which it was produced (p. 416). As such, Zakharieva argues, the ﬁlm manifests the “end-of-the-millennium obsession with . . . originality and authenticity” that characterized the nineties, an obsession evident in everything from the title (which sug- gests that this movie version of the legend will take the “true-to-the- original approach”), to the “effort of the director to speak through the original artistic codes of the Romantics,” to the “postmodern attempt to render visually the ‘truth’ of a particular historical time” through lav- ish “settings and costumes” (p. 417). In fact, though, Branagh’s ﬁlm is shown by Zakharieva to be, in many ways, untrue to the original text and context. For example, visual effects often amount to Romantic kitsch, and the ﬁrst of the movie’s two birth scenes — a scene (in which “blood abounds” [p. 421]) depic- ting Frankenstein’s mother dying while giving birth to his brother — distorts Mary Shelley’s novel in several ways. For one thing, in the novel, Frankenstein’s mother dies of scarlet fever, not while giving birth. For another, Branagh’s depiction of this made-up moment reﬂects both a late-twentieth-century “awareness of the body” and a tendency to represent “corporality” (p. 421) naturalistically, materially, and explicitly — in other words, in all of its “ ‘ﬂeshy’ ” (p. 421) glory or goriness! Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, like Iames Whale’s 1931 ﬁlm version of the Frankenstein legend, also departs from the original in its treatment of the novel’s other “birth” scene, i.e., the one involving “the creation of a living creature from dead bodies by an (obsessed) scientist. . . . what in the novel is allotted a mere paragraph with no details of the actual process, only a description of the result, i.e., the appearance of the creature, becomes in the ﬁlms an elaborate, highly visualized scene of creation” (p. 417). Zakharieva suggests that this “emphasis on theWHAT IS CULTURAL CRITICISM? 409 process is . . . dictated by the very nature of film art” (p. 417), which creates the illusion of unity and authenticity through the editor's cuts and splices, much as the creature in Mary Shelley’s novel is created through “cutting and montage,” a technology not unlike filmmaking (p. 418). In earlier film versions such as Whale's, the emphasis on creation as science rather than as mystery or miracle allowed directors to deal with moral questions that had arisen in an era of fascist atrocities: questions regarding evil manipulators, their ability to turn people into robots, and, in short, the “instrumentalization of the human being with its fur- ther implications of human and social degradation” (p. 419). Similarly, in Branagh’s version, the scientifically created creature “becomes a sophisticated compound of symbolized science, medicine, and technol- ogy” (p. 423). A “representation” of the “merger of the given (the organic) and the produced (the mechanical),” the creature becomes an occasion for questioning whether nature and technology can ever be merged without disastrous effects. Ironically, Zakharieva suggests, it is in asking this most contemporary of questions that Branagh's film is truest to the original text, for Mary Shelley’s great innovation was what Zakharieva calls “the composite body,” a misshapen product of science and biology through which she expressed not her Romantic faith in nature and the human imagination but, rather, her “Romantic doubts” about human nature and the direction of its likely evolution. Zakharieva’s wide-ranging essay (which is difficult to preview, let alone summarize, with any degree of justice), exemplifies cultural criti- cism in a number of ways. Highly informed by popular culture, past and present, it analyzes Mary Shelley's Frankenstein not only in light of Whale's Frankenstein but also with reference to more contemporary films such as The Terminator, and other movies populated by “half- human, half-machine” bodies immune to pain, mortality, death, emo- tion, and morality (p. 425). Also typical of the cultural critic's approach is Zakharieva’s insistence on framing her arguments, whether they con- cern Shelley’s creature or contemporary cyborgs, in the contemporary theoretical discourse concerning the body, gender, and the construc- tion of identity. Most generally, though, “Frankenstein of the Nineties: The Composite Body” exemplifies cultural criticism by viewing a nineteenth-century novel through the lens of several twentieth-century films — and by viewing novel and films as neither historical artifacts nor aesthetic objects but, rather, as manifestations of the cultural climates in which they arose and are interpreted.

I am not concerned with the aesthetic quality of Branagh’s ﬁlm, which is generally consid- ered unsatisfactory in ideological complexity, artistic scope, and emo- tional power. Instead I vwll consider the artistic strategies of the ﬁlm as a “symptom” of the cultural climate of the nineties; in other words, I will look at its problematics and visuality as the result of a particular aes- thetic choice. My approach to the strategy of selection will not be determined by the assumption that it is a conscious act of the director; I would rather look at the cultural context itself as motivating this choice and becoming on its part another textual source of the ﬁlm (together with the literary text of Mary Shelley’s novel). Such a “symptom” analysis opens up a hermeneutical circle of social and cultural factors which have subtly worked their way into the ﬁlm. It also allows for a singling out of motifs and elements within the ﬁlm that are important exclusively in the current cultural context rather than in their belonging to the closed system of the ﬁlm text. Why is Kenneth Branagh’s ﬁlm entitled Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, an insistence from the very beginning on the true-to-the-original approach? The title announces a “return” to the classical source, the resurrection of the authentic Frankenstein. The initial promise of the ﬁlm is to recover the origin of a legend that has become part of the pop- ular imagination, to reintroduce on the cultural scene the original as the bearer of the high Romantic values bestowed upon it by a long his- tory of Shelley criticism. This is a speciﬁc illustration of the end-of- the-millennium obsession with originals in an age that has radically questioned the status of the very concept of originality and authenticity. Thus the gesture of cultural “valorization” becomes the proper post- modern token of actualizing the work — politically and ideologically.BOURIANA ZAKHARIEVA 417 This impossible striving for authenticity which the film unwittingly exemplifies is, in fact, its politically relevant and engaging message, more interesting, perhaps, than the trivial “warnings” about the ethical prob- lems which arise from the splitting of genes in modern laboratories. This effort of the director to speak through the original artistic codes of the Romantics resembles very much Frankenstein’s attempt to reproduce the authentic codes and mechanisms of Nature in a perfect artificial man. I will deal with the similarities and differences between Mary Shel- ley’s literary original and Whale’s and Branagh's film adaptations and their respective significance concerning the object of my present inves- tigation, namely the “nature” of Frankenstein’s creation. The Branagh film’s almost caricatural period-piece atmosphere illustrates the postmodern attempt to render visually the “truth” of a particular historical time through its rather clichéd, popular, and media- digested version. Its “authentic” settings and costumes, as well as the “Romantic” landscapes, meet the requirements of the Hollywood “Gothic” and demonstrate a Caspar David Friedrich filtered through the kitsch of the popular perception of “beautiful nature.” This quality of Branagh’s film marks a considerable distinction from James Whale’s 1931 and 1935 adaptations, which are visually stylized and unrepresen- tative of any particular historical period or place. As many critics have noted, although the films diverge from the novel, there seems to be a recurrent plot invariant: the creation of a liv- ing creature from dead bodies by an (obsessed) scientist. With time, as Paul O'Flinn ingeniously argues in an article about the differences between Whale’s and Hammer's adaptations in the thirties and fifties respectively, the emphasis has shifted from the “nature” of the creation to the character of the creator (21). In any case, the “birth” of the arti- ficial creature remains the central event of all works based on the leg- end. Yet, what in the novel is allotted a mere paragraph with no details of the actual process, only a description of the result, i.e., the appear- ance of the creature, becomes in the films an elaborate, highly visual- ized scene of creation. This emphasis on the process is not only dictated by the very nature of film art with its demands for spectacularness, but it is simultaneously the point where film art and scientific creation are able to mutually comment on each other. The film, seen as a generator of life through the mechanical movement of pictures, and the Romantic narrative of the creation of an artificial being coincide in their principle of animation. William Nestrick highlights this feature of Frankenstein's film adaptations:418 CULTURAL CRITICISM The ﬁlm is the animation of the machine, a continuous life created by the persistence of vision in combination with a machine casting light through individual photographs ﬂashed separately upon the screen. Since “life” in ﬁlm is movement, the word that bridges the worlds of ﬁlm and man is “animation”— the basic principle by which motion is imparted to the picture. (294-95) I would like to carry this argument further by introducing montage as the cinematic principle proper of creating a screen character. A ﬁlm individual can be “born” through the montage of different parts of dif- ferent real-life individuals. The same principle of montage accounts for the originality of Mary Shelley’s monster. Or, to paraphrase Nestrick: the word that bridges the world of ﬁlm and man (or monster) is the word montage. What differentiates Frankenstein’s creature from other folk or Romantic narratives of creation of artiﬁcial beings is the fact that it is created from dead bodies — it is above all a composite body. Contrary to the animated puppets, mannequins, or statuettes of the Romantic period (e.g. in E.T.A. Hoffmann’s tales), Mary Shelley introduces two innovations to the traditional narratives of creation: ﬁrst, the scientiﬁc method, and second, the idea of a composite body. The innovation of scientiﬁc method, or creation through science as opposed to magic or miracle, brings together a number of issues. For Mary Shelley and her generation these issues are conditioned by the Romantic weltanschau- ung: the opposition of intellect and feeling; a humanistic disappoint- ment in scientiﬁc progress; the moral consequences of science probing into the secrets of life/nature and the Christian implications of this problem; the utopian visions of a new Man (a new society) as a direct ideological response to the political ideas of the French Revolution, etc. Moreover, the innovation of the composite body, of creation through cutting and montage, brings the ideology of Frankenstein closer to the aesthetics of cinema. As the principle of montage in cinema works against the classical aesthetics of representation and undermines the idea of authenticity, so does the composite Monster problematize the idea of the natural man as integral being. This Monster also questions the limits and nature of the organic as an axiomatic given, the binary opposition of the given versus the produced, nature versus culture. The organic is now the technical;1 it is culturally constructed, not naturally ‘As Iean-Francois Lyotard explains, since “techne is the abstract from tikto which means to engender; to generate [tekontes, the genitors; teknon, the offspring],” it is “per- fectly possible to say that the living cell, and the organism with its organs, are alreadyBOURIANA ZAKHARIEVA 419 given, and the body is always already discursive. All these problematics acquire new connotations under the speciﬁc social and cultural condi- tions of the 1930s when Iames Whale produces his ﬁrst ﬁlm version, as they do again in the nineties. It is well known that the 1930s Frankenstein appeared in the con- text of a growing public fascination with ﬁlm characters like Caligari (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, 1919), Fritz Lang’s Mabuse (Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler, 1922) and Maria (Metropolis, 1927), and the Golem (The Golem, 1920). These characters were either robots or evil hypnotizers who turned people into robots. The German and the American produc- tions engaged in the “mechanics” of man manipulation and the manip- ulated individual as an instrument of evil, in which the invention gained control over the creator-inventor. From Caligarfs inscription on the fair-tent “Man or Machine” (Kracauer 62) to The Golem (Glut 129), the moral issue of animation/creation of an artiﬁcial being is repre- sented through machine metaphors that come to illustrate the idea of instrumentalization of the human being with its further implications of human and social degradation. On a political level, this trend can be interpreted as a premonition of the dangers of the then rising fascist ideology. In that framework, the character of the mad scientist becomes important retrospectively, given the discovery of the collaborative role of scholars in fascist atrocities during World War II. Whale’s Frankenstein, although wary of the dangers of scientiﬁc progress in a more religious/ ethical light (the creation of soulless man), carries political connotations as well. It is politically relevant in two respects. The ﬁrst is Dr. Frankenstein’s treatment of the human brain as “only a piece of dead tissue.” This sinisterly materialist statement in fact presents a rationalist worldview where the concept of matter- soulless, uniform, and homogeneous — implies no limit to scientiﬁc experimentation. Since according to this perception, everything hu- man boils down to the mere form or existence of matter, everything becomes possible. The ﬁlm also tends to illustrate and “prove” the interdependence between matter and its human manifestations. The degenerate (“abnormal”) brain is the brain of the criminal “monster”; tekhnai, that ‘life,’ as they say, is already technique” (52). On the other hand, in ancient Greek again, organon means tool, instrument, apparatus (as well as human organ), and organikos means instrumental, performed by means of instruments. The contrast between the two concepts of technical and organic developed later on, in the course of Western tradition. Initially the two concepts mirrored each other, each carrying the connotations of its opposite — life is technique, organic is instrumental — and current humanistic scholarship seems to have come full circle back to this idea of mirroring.420 CULTURAL CRITICISM in other words, a physiological (material) basis for criminal activity is established. Such views set up the framework for the science of Dr. Cesare Lom- broso, author of The Criminal Man, at the turn of the century. He used anthropological measurements to prove inborn criminality. No need to remind ourselves here that racial theories ground themselves in this concept of the physiological basis of inferiority. In terms of plot at least, Whale’s ﬁlm too relies on this concept — it is the switch of the good (normal) brain for the bad (abnormal) one that predetermines the monstrosity and dangerousness of the Creature. Its anthropological features — large, ﬂat-domed skull, sinking blank watery eyes, long clumsy hands, and large stumbling legs — deﬁne it in terms of “savage- ness” or debility as conceived by those racial theories. It is true that Whale’s Frankenstein and the sequel The Bride of Frankenstein (1935) also stress the natural innocence of the creature, his pitiful loneliness and search for a “friend,” but this is, nevertheless, the innocence of a savage whose strength and brainless actions bring nothing but destruc- tion. This concept of evil as inherent in a misshapen corporality is demonstrated once again in the character of the scientist’s assistant Fritz, a dwarﬁsh hunchback with bulging eyes, who is ready to torture the Creature for no reason. Thus, the binding of the evil manifestations of the character with corporality and savageness, becomes an inherent element of the style of the Bride ﬁlm. The Creature grumbles, moans, and displays an avaricious sexuality; it is moved by music but seems to take to wine as well (a savage inclination). This “primitive susceptibil- ity” to degeneration is demonstrated not only in the scene with the blind man but also in an episode with Dr. Pretorius, who seems to be able to control the savage monster by simply offering him food and wine — a clichéd representation of a relationship between “civilized man” and “savage,” the white master and the would-be-slave native. The other political message of the 1931 Frankenstein, which unin- tentionally contributes to the complexity of the ﬁlm as well, is the effec- tive representation of the community. The mob scenes are among the best in the movie: the vulgar masses (warmed up by the beer of the Master) serve as a chilling representation of a lynching crowd—a monster in itself set out to destroy Him, who is not one of them. A Hollywood-cast image of a hysterical crowd on a community-cleansing “mission” sounds prophetic in the 1930s, especially when the setting is presumably Germany. O’Flinn’s interpretation of the ﬁnal episode in Whale’s ﬁlm, though, implies a directly American referent: “as the blaze engulfs the blades [of the mill] they form a gigantic ﬁery cross thatBOURIANA ZAKHARI EVA 421 deliberately suggests the Ku Klux Klan, virulently active at that time” (36). In either case, the message is the same: a reconstitution of the integrity of the communal body through the act of exclusion. It remains somewhat problematic, however, whether the ﬁlm condones this act or not. The issue of corporality becomes of particular interest in the post- modern cultural setting of the new Frankenstein of the nineties. A new awareness of the body and its discursive paradigms, as well as the politi- cal implications of its representation, sets the background for the cine- matic aesthetics of Kenneth Branagh’s ﬁlm? This is, of course, most clearly demonstrated in the episode of creation. Iuxtaposed to the old versions and the novel itself, Branagh’s ﬁlm presents two scenes of birth (creation.) The ﬁrst scene is of natural birth — Frankenstein’s brother is born and this causes his mother’s death. In the novel, Frankenstein’s mother dies of scarlet fever after taking care of the sick Elizabeth, the hero’s future bride. This episode has a dual function in the novel: it completes the characterization of the mother as the charitable nurtur- ing female, an example of Christian selﬂessness; and, within a Freudian framework, it foreshadows the substitution of the mother for the bride (the mother dies because of the disease contracted from the bride, but the bride is saved). Elizabeth’s introduction into the plotline is effected speciﬁcally through the mother’s remark: “I have a pretty present for my Victor— to-morrow he shall have it” (p. 44). The mother’s death — a substitution for Elizabeth’s— in fact completes the “delivery” of the present. The oedipal motif of substitution of mother/ bride is reinforced in Frankenstein’s dream after the creation of the monster — the hero sees himself kissing Elizabeth but instead holds the corpse of his mother. Branagh chooses to show a scene of natural birth and he does it in a “naturalistic” way. Visually, the episode is on the edge between the rep- resentation of birth and of death. Actually, the scene is functionally both, because while giving birth to her child, the mother dies. The pre- dominant colors in the episode are red (blood) and white (death). The blood abounds — it is smeared over the bodies of the mother and father, it mixes with the birth waters, soaks the white shirts, and makes the bodies look sticky, deﬁled, organic, ultimately material, that is — “ﬂeshy.” Corporality is presented in its most tangible aspects and is not 2What I mean here by “discursive paradigms” is the various ways in which the body is represented in the discourses ofWestern culture — for instance, the Christian body is dif- ferent from a medical / social view of the body in a novel by E. Zola.422 CULTURAL CRITICISM mediated by the consecrated magic of birth and its cultural rituals. Thus, birth acquires the characteristics of a simple pulling of one body out of another body, the cutting of a corpus out of another corpus, a severance of flesh from flesh: a massacre. Seen through Frankenstein’s eyes (the shot when he opens the door and sees his mother already dead), the lifeless body of his mother resembles a massacred body. The filmic resolution is a baroque scene — the camera in a high-angle shot focuses through circular movement on the “slain” body spread out in the folds of bloody covers. Birth is seen as murder and Frankenstein’s denial of his mother’s death is in fact a denial of natural birth. This denial is the basis of his obsession with his future scientific discovery. At his mother's grave he swears to “stop this” (put an end to death). The result of his scientific research is the artificial creation of a human being, an unnatural birth. “Birth” by a male substitutes for female birth. Thus, Frankenstein’s scientific hubris can be seen as an expression of a misog- ynist “procreation envy.” Unable to give birth, the male creates. The woman remains bound to the natural, unable to transcend it. Naturally, she dies while giving birth. Like nature itself. To quote Charles Baude- laire, “Woman is natural, that is to say abominable” (25). The abomi- nation of the “natural” dominates the scenes of creation in Branagh’s Frankenstein. Let us now consider the two scenes of birth — the natural (organic) and the unnatural (scientific, mechanical) — as parallel and reverse images. The second, mechanical birth involves a lot of machinery, tech- nical devices and strange contraptions. It is a weird mixture of different symbolizations of “the scientific”— some apparata remind us of alchemical settings; there is a direct reference to Leonardo da Vinci’s scientific research and his chart of the human body; there are visual quotations from James Whale’s films, e.g., the mechanism of lifting the body and the role of the lightning in the creation process as a life-giving force. But the scientific creation of man in Branagh’s film involves something absent from earlier versions. In the new film the composite body is immersed in amniotic fluids, an indispensable organic compo- nent of life. When the Creature comes to life, it breaks out of the metal container (the surrogate womb) and the birth waters flow out. The body that emerges is naked (not dressed as in the 1930s films), slimy, and helpless – the body of a newborn man. Creator and creation embrace in an ambivalent scene of struggle and affection; their hug is an expression of a desire to separate from each other and at the same time to help each other stand erect. Thus, the birth episode becomes a symbolic representation of human evolution, an ontogenesis and phy-BOURIANA ZAKHARIEVA 423 logenesis merged in one, as well as an icon of the love-hate relationship between creator and creation. The newborn body is pathetic and abject, it is still only a body without a face: Robert De Niro as the Crea- ture is shot from behind. And it is the face that is to become the visual- ization of the Creature’s deformity. This body is sublime — a new Adam arising from the organic mass/ mess of life and death. Death is an important component because the new Adam’s body is composed of dead bodies, a “raw material” restructured and enlivened by the physical force of natural electric power (the lightning). Branagh’s Creature ultimately becomes a so- phisticated compound of symbolized science, medicine, and technol- ogy as cultural phenomena, on one hand, and of sublime nature, on the other. It is a merger of the given (the organic) and the produced (the mechanical). While the body is viable, strong, and imbued with the op- timism of science and progress, the face of the new Creature has re- sisted the merger — it is the expression of aborted birth, of creation gone wrong. It is cut across by the stitches of the merger, scarred in nonmatching patches. Ugly and monstrous, the face becomes the site of the conﬂict raging between the constituting parts. The face, this tra- ditional “mirror” of the human soul, with its misﬁtting parts, questions the existence of this very “soul” that grounds the deﬁnition of a uniﬁed being. “Organic” man is whole and integral; “mechanical” man is the composite, his “soul” is both problematic and a source of problems. “What of my soul? Do I have one? Was that the part you left out?” asks De Niro’s character. Branagh’s Creature here echoes Mary Shelley’s Romantic doubts. The sentimental current underpinning the Romantic movement ﬁnds full force in the conﬂict between the mechanical and the natural. The gloriﬁcation of the natural is in its essence a fear for the lost soul of man. This fear is the counterpart of the twentieth-century concern with pro- gressive dehumanization (of society and art). Yet, Mary Shelley suc- ceeds in showing monstrosity not only in its metaphysical aspect, as abiding in the “mechanical,” but also as resulting from the evils of the social realm. The solitude of man, the lack of communality, the mecha- nisms of exclusion and scapegoating are at the bottom of the drama of not only the Creature, but other characters, too: for instance, the De Laceys and Iustine. “All men hate the wretched; how then must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things!” exclaims Mary Shel- ley’s monster (93). The logic of sociality grounded in hatred of the dif- ferent (the “wretched”), the Other, permeates the plot of the novel. The ﬁlm adds to this logic a new aspect. In the novel the destructive424 CULTURAL CRITICISM mechanism in the Creature is set to work only when he faces the rejec- tion of his creator and of society. Thus, natural and primitive man is seen as the pure (unspoiled by society) human being who, in the process of his development among other men, becomes eventually a “product” of social relations. In this opposition of the organic and the produced, Evil is on the side of the produced, Good is on the side of the natural. The logic of modernism and postmodernism questions this simple equation of “natural” and “good.” It is the modernist Baudelaire who believes that natural man is evil man. He writes in his Intimate ]ournals of a “natural delight in crime” and “natural pleasure in destruction” (27). In Baudelaire’s chart of dichotomies, “natural” is also “woman,” “vulgar,” “brutal,” “potent.” A long modernist tradition conceives of the organic and the natural in terms of an “excess” that is also potent and transgressive. In Georges Bataille, whose “heroes” include Baude- laire, Marquis de Sade, Franz Kafka, and Iean Genet; in Sartre and his “saint Genet”; in Michel Foucault and his Pierre Riviere; and then in the post-Foucauldian tradition — the excessive is amoral (in a Niet- zschean sense) and subversive. Branagh’s ﬁlm, although not always consistently, pays tribute to this conception. This is demonstrated in the elaborate animosity and cruelty of Robert De Niro’s character. While Mary Shelley always provides complex psychological motivations for the Creature’s cruelty, the ﬁlm is laconic and ambivalent in this respect. The character’s cruelty is deﬁned by a corporal immediacy, it is unmediated. His violence unleashes spon- taneously and takes surprisingly eerie turns. It ignites instinctively (in the chance encounter with William, Frankenstein’s brother), or cun- ningly (in the episode with Iustine), or with sadistic sophistication (in the wedding-night scene). This is partially dictated by the very nature of cinema, which must visualize the psychological, as well as by the genre of the ﬁlm, which promises in an introductory statement to pro- vide Gothic horrors that “curdle the blood.” Still, the Creature’s visual characterization allows for a different interpretation of its cruelty. Branagh’s creature is powerful because it is cruel, it dominates through the intensity of unmotivated evil; it operates a primordial force which is only retrospectively rationalized to intensify its daunting potential. Branagh turns upside down Whale’s version of the monster-with-the- criminal-mind: he inserts in his creation the brain of “the most clever man”— Dr. Waldman, Frankenstein’s inspiring teacher. Thus, the rational aspect in the Creature’s character is discarded as irrelevant (the Creature is what he is, despite the brain he was given). It is the bodyBOURIANA ZAKHARIEVA 425 that contains criminal constituents; it is put together from organs of convicts’ corpses. The bodily aspect is powerful and dominating; it has swallowed the social and transcended the rational in the same way as the plague obliterates distinctions within the social and the rational. In this respect, it is not accidental that the Creature is delivered in a world plagued by death. Branagh’s ﬁlm features the closed city of Ingolstadt devastated by cholera, the hysterical crowd of human bodies overwhelmed by approaching imminent death, the carts in the streets brimming with dead bodies. All these details magnify the corporal aspect of the ﬁlm. In times of plague, when the human is reduced to hysterical ﬂesh, disruption and chaos reign; and the abject, deformed, and incomplete body signiﬁes this all-encompassing disorder. What causes abjection is “what disturbs identity, system, order. The in- between, the ambiguous, the composite” (Kristeva 4). It is an ambigu- ous body (half-human, half-machine): incomplete and unﬁnished. The Creature’s lack of name is perceived by the character himself as a sign of incompleteness. The lack of name is a lack of social endorsement, of inclusion under the Law of the Father, of self-identity. When asked at the end of the ﬁlm, “Who are you?” the Creature’s answer is: “He never gave me a name.” The lack of name makes impossible an answer to the question “Who are you?” De Niro’s character is given some lines, absent from the book origi- nal, that further elaborate on the problem of the Creature’s composite body. In the cave (a symbolic womb to which the Creator and his prog- eny “return”), the Creature confronts Victor with his questions: “Who am I? . . . Who are the people of which I am comprised? Bad people?” He wants to know how it is possible that he can play the ﬂute: “In which part of me does this knowledge reside: in this hand, in this mind, this heart? And speaking — not so much things learned as things remembered?” These lines allude to something that may be called “cor- poral memory.” There is a sensational “tabloid” aspect to this notion, which I will immediately dismiss in order to deal with the ambiguous political implications of this important scene. The short and suggestive dialogue highlights the new importance of the corporal (the organic), which is absent from the early ﬁlm versions (too abstract) and from the novel (too psychological). The episode stresses exactly this “hypercor- porality”: the Creature discusses his own body, and this body — frag- mented, ambiguous, abject — which he can neither comprehend nor apprehend is a central problem for the character. It is the body that “remembers” (and it is a “re-membered” body); it “knows” and acts out that knowledge; in other words, it is already discursive. Yet, the426 CULTURAL CRITICISM notion of a “remembering” body is one step away from the theories of “organic memory” (cf. Otis) extremely popular at the beginning of the twentieth century, a version of whose physiological determinism we see illustrated in Whale’s concept of “abnormality” and “monstrosity.” But while Whale’s ﬁlm tends to resolutely and simplistically “explain” human behavior, Branagh’s poses a problem. In the new ﬁlm adapta- tion the body stands out because it is problematic. Being disorderly and creating disorder, the body becomes visible, not “transparent.” The dysfunctional body, hence, is made to function aesthetically. David Thomson writes in Film Review that “special effects have made a plaything of the body.” Actors are being employed more and more “as phantoms, half-alive or undead, ﬁgures in the ﬂux of fantasy, images that will be worked on in Effects” (25). Cyborgs populate the contemporary screen — half-human, half-machine, they celebrate a body that denies pain, mortality, and death. This applies in particular to violent ﬁlms where violence has explicitly picturesque manifestations but no corporal dimension. For example in The Terminator the body is a “special effect,” the Terminator is born out of nowhere in an instant of a cosmic electric impulse (another birth by means of electricity). But the fearful muscular body of the Terminator is totally “inorganic,” it is antithetical to the composite body of Frankenstein’s creature. It is an absolute creation of the ﬁlm medium — a harmonious and proportion- ate naked body emerges on the screen; it is uniﬁed, powerwise very effective, but in fact physically absent. Contrary to Frankenstein’s Mon- ster it is aesthetically functional not through its corporality (compli- cated and deformed as it is) but because of the lack of it. Modern cyborgs have gone far beyond the Romantic and modernist contrast of human versus machine —they are the effect of a machine, a mere image, a series of light impulses. The interest in the contrast between organic and mechanical, nat- ural and produced, inherent in the aesthetics of the Romantics and the new adaptation of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, is in accord with the postmodern politics of the body, feminism, and identity politics. It is in this respect that Branagh’s ﬁlm relates to the current cultural situation, rather than the more obvious and superﬁcial intention to make what one critic called some “knowing winks at the medical ethics of the mod- ern age” (Lane 142). In fact, Whale’s version of the legend already plays with this Romantic contrast. Karloff’s Monster is at least half- machine, and the Creature’s efforts to awaken to the human constitute the dramatic effort of the actor’s performance. The ﬁlm also features a very machine-dominated scene of creation, and the laboratory setting isBOURIANA ZAKHARIEVA 427 constructivist in style: wheels and relays, electric circuits and bulbs, ele- vating devices, etc., as opposed to tubes and retorts ﬁlled with bubbly liquids of the clichéd lab setting. Whale’s laboratory is a machine in itself and what it produces is a semimachine, yet the act of creation retains some spectacular mystic-religious connotations. The Creature is lifted up against the sky through the open roof and there, above, against the background of gloomy and disapproving heavens the mys- tery of creation takes place — lightning strikes, and its bolt is life-giving as the touch of an evil god. The workings of science are shrouded in mystique. In Branagh’s Frankenstein, the workings of nature and science are both stripped of religious mystique. The scene of scientiﬁc delivery is an attempt to stage an alternative to natural delivery. The latter ends in death, the former starts from death (dead bodies) and tries to reverse the process. Visually, the laboratory resembles that of an alchemist — but the “raw material” of the experiment, taking place there, is the human body. (Later, however, it turns out to be more than just that.) This setting stresses the surrealist, nightmarish, subconscious connota- tions of the act of creating the monster.3 One of the main differences between Branagh’s ﬁlm and the novel concerns the plotline of the female creature, the monster’s partner. The creation of a female companion for the Monster is also the focal point of the sequel to Whale’s Frankenstein— The Bride of Frankenstein (1935). In the novel, Victor “[tears] to pieces the thing on which [he] was engaged” (p. 145) in fear of creating yet another monster. As sug- gested by Susan Wolfson, “feminine monstrosity is suppressed because it is too potent, immune to all regulation and control” (57). What is never completed in the novel becomes the central event in the sequel. In Whale’s versions, Victor, the scientist, is never deprived of his com- panion Elizabeth. In the ﬁrst ﬁlm the Creature just threatens Victor’s bride, their encounter is brief and charged with suppressed erotic ten- sion. The monstrous creation of Man’s passion faces the innocent Vir- gin in a scene styled very much in the beauty-and-the-beast Hollywood aesthetics. In the initial script of the Bride a scene of Elizabeth’s murder was included, her heart “transplanted” into the Monster’s mate. But this was considered too gruesome for the taste of the audience and in the actual ﬁlm the heart is “taken” from an unidentiﬁed woman (killed by one of the secondary characters, Mad Karl). The female creature’s 3It is not accidental that one of the founding metaphors of surrealism is that of alchemy.428 CULTURAL CRITICISM body is assembled from dead bodies and the brain is developed “scien- tifically” by Dr. Pretorius's own process. While in the novel Elizabeth is killed only after, and because of, Victor’s refusal to create a female part- ner for the Creature, in the 1935 version Elizabeth is not killed. A female partner for Boris Karloff is created, but after she rejects her groom in horror and disgust, he destroys her, the laboratory, and him- self in a fit of suicidal rage and despair. Thus, in this filmic plot, the “romance” of the humans is not disturbed by the dramatic events and, contrary to the literary original, the relations between Frankenstein and his creature are inconsequential for the doctor’s erotic relationships. Similarly, the relationship between the Creature and his Bride remains only within the limits of the laboratory, a truly isolated “monstrous” affair. The separate plotlines of the two couples (human and monster) do not overlap in any substantial way. Branagh's film takes up the motif of the creation of an artificial female (which has a film history of its own starting with Fritz Lang's Metropolis, 1926). But contrary to the novel, in Branagh's film the cre- ation of the bride takes place after the murder of Elizabeth. Victor cre- ates a “female companion” for himself— not for the Creature – in an attempt to compensate for Elizabeth's death. Frankenstein’s “compos- ite” bride is made up of the bodies of Justine and Elizabeth, both of whom love Frankenstein and are desired by the Creature. Both are killed by the Monster with Victor's indirect complicity. Thus, Franken- stein creates a bride for himself but his horrible progeny wants to share her with him. The bride is not a completely new being, she is a re- creation of the two women to whom Frankenstein is bound through his sense of guilt. The female creature is torn between her lover and his evil counterpart – the Monster, Facing a choice between the two men, engaged in something reminiscent of a primordial battle of the males, she destroys herself. The allegorism of this episode is rather primitive but suggestive of a narrative logic that does not remain merely on the level of the creation of Woman (as a replica of the already accomplished creation of Man). The scene is catastrophic, the woman sets the home on fire; this is the climax of Frankenstein's story, before the closing "framing” narrative in the Arctic Sea. The plot thus builds the character of Frankenstein in the double role of creator and murderer of his bride- On the other hand, the bride does not simply reject the Monster as in !he Sride of Frankenstein, where she is terrified by his monstrosity - SHe must shoose between the two men, but she rejects the very necessity of shotse. She disappoints the spectators expectations of seeing Ber **ss between the two men as in any classic love triangle. This ir--BOURIANA ZAKHARIEVA 429 cial creature demonstrates a decisiveness seen in neither of the females “comprising” her: Iustine and Elizabeth are exemplary in their femi- nine devotion and submissiveness. Without the least strain on the imag- ination, the viewer can interpret the suicide of this bride (shoved into her bridal gown soon after she was brought to life) as a sort of modern- woman gesture of independence, an ironic comment on the traditional female role as represented by Iustine and Elizabeth. Still, as feminist critics have argued, it is the murder/suicide of woman, as a retribution for female desire, that makes up the patriarchal plot (cf. de Lauretis, ch. 5). Or, in Laura Mulvey’s famous remark, “sadism demands a story” (311). This is emphasized by the two most cruel and “spectacular” murder scenes in the ﬁlm, showing Iustine’s body hanging from the town wall and Elizabeth’s throbbing heart in the monster’s hands. The violation of the female body makes a most engaging spectacle. An important patriarchal cultural convention is reinforced through the fact that the body is virginal. In Rex Ingram’s The Magician (a silent ﬁlm of the 1920s), for example, the sorcerer Oliver Haddo needs the heart’s blood of a maiden in order to create life (Glut 131). As Victor Frankenstein reaches out to conquer the ultimate secret of Nature, cast by nineteenth-century scientiﬁc discourse in fem- inine terms (Mellor 107-39), so does the Monster reach out to destroy the ultimate abode of humanity/femininity, which has been socially denied him. The heart of the virgin Elizabeth ripped out of her body illustrates the Creature’s sublime act of cruelty. The symbol of the virgin female heart (the conventional sign of femininity) seems to be one of the “eternal” tropes of patriarchal culture. Even when its sym- bolic messages are somewhat tired, it is still tireless in providing the spectacle of male power. Other versions of Frankenstein made the head (brain) of the male Creature the most symbolically crucial component of his body (another “eternal” metaphor) but not Branagh’s ﬁlm. Yet, the female body, though composite like the male, still has a symbolic focus — the heart. In a critical analysis of Metropolis, where Maria, the woman with a good heart, becomes the mediator between the “hands” (the workers) and the “brain” (power, science), Carol Diethe refers to Mary Shelley’s work: . . . [Shelley’s] reprobation manifests itself in the lack of any woman character in the novel who, being closer to nature with her intuition and sympathy, could set affairs to rights at the end of the tale. . . . In Frankenstein then, woman’s capacity to restore order is precisely what is missing . . . (111)43O CULTURAL CRITICISM Branagh's film may serve as an illustration of this observation. It maintains this dichotomy of wronged and violated Nature/Woman/ Good versus Science/Man/Evil. Plunged forcefully into the realm of competing males, the artificial female creature annihilates herself only to reinstate through this act the uncontested rule of male power. The world of the Arctic Sea “of ice,” the frame of the film, is a world with- out females. It is there, in the infinity of a womanless, icy, barren, “sus- pended” Nature, that the “foul reality” can be finally transcended and the essential and final problems of being are to be faced — by men.

In this section of the book, the emphasis changes, for the goal is to demonstrate not the uniqueness of the vari- ous approaches but, rather, their permeability to one another, their potential for overlap. The essay that follows, by Fred Botting, allows us to see how a critic can draw upon the insights of several critical tradi- tions (in effect, combining perspectives) to present a view of a work unavailable from any one window, any single critical perspective. Botting begins by discussing the “ﬁgure of the monster” in English political discourse following the French Revolution. Arguing that monster metaphors tend to mark the “limits” or “boundaries” of po- litical positions, showing the extremes at which they resemble some other position or otherwise become untenable, unstable, or self- undermining, Botting proceeds by describing Mary Shelley’s Franken- stein not just as a work containing a monster but as a monstrous text (p. 435 in this volume). It is monstrous in the sense that, like Franken- stein’s creature, it is an “assemblage” of pieces — a novel containing diverse fragments of poetry, myth, philosophy, history, and folktale — and also because it “occupies an unstable space” (p. 437) between “lit- erary tradition and popular culture,” undermining the autonomy of each by being an extreme form of both. 437-COMBINING PERSPECTIVF5 433 Botting similarly uses the monster metaphor to describe his own essay, occupying as it does a similarly unstable space between suppos- edly autonomous critical discourses and being, in its own way, a textual assemblage. “Formed” in “the diverse conjunctions of and differences between various theories,” “informed” by the work of three theorists Botting speciﬁcally cites — Iacques Lacan (see “What Is Psychoanalytic Criticism?” pp. 269-72), Iacques Derrida (see the deﬁnition of decon- struction in the Glossary), and Michel Foucault (see “What Is Gender Criticism?” pp. 338-39, “What Is Cultural Criticism?” pp. 401-02, and the Glossary deﬁnition of new historicism) — Botting’s essay de- clares itself “an amalgam . . . of disparate elements,” a “paper. . . situated along lines of intersection and divergence between several theoretical positions” (p. 437). Returning to the subject of English political writing about the French Revolution, Botting takes the position shared by cultural critics and new historicists that histories of other cultures, and the means by which their “otherness” is represented, reﬂect the historian’s view of his or her own times and culture. Thus, Botting argues, Edmund Burke’s Reﬂections on the Revolution in France represents revolutionary mobs, the French National Assembly, and France’s written constitution as monsters in order to deﬁne not only the putative normalcy of the En- glish status quo but also the dangerous extremes of English liberty. At these extremes, English radicals were, in Burke’s conservative view, threatening English autonomy by publicly advocating revolution in a discourse that pretended to be political argument but in reality was “monstrous ﬁction” (p. 439). Burke’s opponents, of course, were responding in kind: the radical Tom Paine described Burke’s views and methods as “ ‘marvellous and monstrous,’” (p. 440), and Mary Shel- ley’s mother and father, Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin, characterized as monstrous England’s hereditary class system and gov- ernmental structure, respectively. When Botting returns his attention from the discourse of English politics to that of Frankenstein, he augments the assumptions of new historicism and cultural criticism with insights borrowed from decon- struction, psychoanalytic criticism, gender criticism, and even reader- response criticism (a critical approach to literature that Botting doesn’t speciﬁcally mention but is deﬁned in this volume’s glossary). Following the lead of Derrida and other deconstructors, who argue that texts involve opposed and contradictory “strands of discourse,” Botting suggests that Frankenstein contains, “entangles,” and also “parodies” (p. 443) both Burke’s conservative and Godwin’s radical positions.434 COMBINING PERSPECTIVES Equally deconstructive is Botting’s argument that this novel advancing and undermining opposed political viewpoints ultimately “blurs all dis- tinctions and questions all limits” (p. 444, emphasis mine). Decon- structive readings tend to “erase the boundaries” between “binary oppositions”; Botting’s reading of Frankenstein deconstructively emphasizes the way in which both creator and creature become master and slave, innocence is deemed guilt, justice proves unjust, confessing becomes lying, and so forth. At times, however, Botting’s reading of the text does more than expose deconstructively what he calls the novel’s “excessive play of dif- ferences” (p. 444). After showing how the novel undermines all “total- izing” ideologies — positions grounded in false dichotomies and ﬁctions of otherness or difference — Botting goes on to suggest that Frankenstein also “engenders different positions” from which “institu- tions” (such as the court that ﬁnds Iustine guilty or the Church that would have her confess a lie) can be “criticize[d]” and “subvert[ed], challenge[d] and transform[ed]” (p. 444). One of those institutions is gender and, more speciﬁcally, masculinity, which deﬁnes itself vis-a-vis distinctions and limits that can, in Elizabeth’s words, make “men appear . . . as monsters” (p. 445). Botting’s interest in masculinity here aligns him with gender criticism; at other points in his analysis, how- ever, his interest in gender issues seems more grounded in the psycho- analytic approach. He views Victor as a Freudian psychoanalyst might— as a man bent on “effac[ing]” from his consciousness and world “women, bodies, sexuality and death,” all of which return from repression in his dreams as well as in reality. Botting’s similarly psychoanalytic reading of “Walton’s ﬁnal situa- tion” as one in which “the ship may be returning home” but Walton’s “gaze still attempts to penetrate the darkness into which the monster disappears” (p. 446) owes more to Lacan than Freud, as do his discus- sions elsewhere of mirror images, subjectivity, and language. And his discussion of “the text’s absent reader, Mrs. Saville” (p. 446), Walton’s sister, is indebted to reader-response criticism, which tends to point out the “readerly” roles played by characters in novels and to discuss the reader’s own position in the text — a position that will in part deter- mine what readers “make” of what they read. Botting points out that “different speakers and writers also occupy the positions of readers and listeners” in Frankenstein, and he concludes his essay by arguing that the “narrative” of Frankenstein, which “encloses the monster’s story within Frankenstein’s, the latter’s being surrounded by Walton’s letters, letters that are addressed to his sister on the edges of the text,” has theFRED BOTTING 435 effect of “mov[ing]” the reader “inward to a presumed centre, the monster’s account of the De Lacey family, and outwards, to the absent addressee on the margins. But the story at the centre fragments, dis- persed by the rage of the monster,” and the novel’s narrative provides “a set of broken” and “unstable frames” (pp. 445, 447) that cause read- ers not only to “inhabit” but also to “generate . . . textual contradic- tions,” that is, not only to “identify and recognize themselves in parts of the text as passive addressees” but also to “resist” that position “and produce readings that attempt to decide Walton’s disturbing dilemma” by “privileg[ing] Frankenstein or the monster” (p. 447). The “con- struction of readers within the text,” Botting concludes — sounding at this point much like a subjectivist reader-response critic —“allots a cer- tain power and resistance to acts of reading and offers subjective posi- tions which can be refused, adopted, or, even, transformed. Who knows? The writer, for sure, does not” (p. 448). Combining as he does cultural, gender, psychoanalytic, and reader- response criticism with the insights of deconstruction and the new his- toricism, Botting mixes approaches in a way that is typical of much contemporary literary scholarship. In doing so, he creates a critical whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Ross C Murﬁn FRED BOTTING Reﬂections of Excess: Frankenstein, the French Revolution, and Monstrosity This essay examines the appearance and effect of monsters in British political positions immediately after the French Revolution and analyses some of their reverberations in Frankenstein. The project, however, is not one that simply tries to identify Frankenstein’s meaning in terms of British exchanges concerned with the French Revolution, it also regards Frankenstein as a novel that provides reﬂections on, as much as reﬂections of, revolutionary and counter-revolutionary texts. Focusing on the repeated appearances of the monster metaphor, the essay attempts to identify some of the implications of the monster’s diverse and proliﬁc animations within different political and literary positions. At once necessary and terribly dangerous, the ﬁgure of the monster takes on a multitude of different forms and functions. Its effects are multiple also: it deﬁnes the limits of a position as a threat to the continued436 COMBINING PERSPECTIVES existence of that position. Constructed as a ﬁgure of transgression, an other that marks out the boundaries of discourse, the monster also begins to disclose internal contradictions within discursive frameworks. Produced by positions that cannot contain them, monsters activate an excessive force which continually poses a challenge to unity, singularity and stability, a threat that demands repeated attempts to reconstitute boundaries from within. The friction involved in this internal and ex- ternal confrontation, however, engenders a proliferation of monsters, an excess that encourages interrogations and transformations which upset the stability and unity of yet more limits and distinctions. The excess marked by various forms of monstrosity can be described loosely, and perhaps monstrously, as a force of difference between opposed poles that questions the privileged status one pole attempts to sustain by disclosing its dependence on its other. Undermining the system which holds distinctions in place, the tension poses further questions and releases further movements of difference. Monsters are thus pro- duced by and also reveal inherent instabilities: refusing to remain in a ﬁxed space of exclusion or to be contained at the margins of any one position, they pose a permanently shifting challenge and produce the possibility of signiﬁcant transformations. The excess that is con- structed by various positions in order to deﬁne their limits also works upon and within them, inhabiting and undermining the ﬁxity of their boundaries. Frankenstein is not only about the manufacture of a monster. It is, as many critics have noted, a monster itself. Like the natural and unnat- ural inhuman human life created by Frankenstein out of pieces from various corpses, the novel is composed from an extensive literary cor- pus: direct citations of Romantic poetry, Paradise Lost and myths of Prometheus, references to many literary, philosophical and historical texts, events and ﬁgures, as well as traces of many others, all distinguish the novel as an “assemblage” of fragments, a disuniﬁed text that sub- verts the possibility and implications of textual and semantic coherence. Indeed, the phrase “my hideous progeny” (p. 25 in this volume) which the author’s 1831 Introduction to the novel uses to describe both book and monster, not only equates the two, but draws the author into the scene of commentary and repetition by suggesting a parallel between the writer’s and Frankenstein’s projects, as well as injecting a note of difference. Unlike Frankenstein, who tries to subject his creation to his will, Mary Shelley makes no such tyrannical gesture: she bids her text- monster farewell and hopes it might “go forth and prosper” (p. 25).FRED BOTTING 437 Ironically her creation obeys, engendering a multitude of monsters and mythical monstrosities on the stage, in cinemas and in books. Many of these reappearances and reproductions of Frankenstein are conservatively recuperated in popular culture and mythology, especially in their silencing of the monster, as Chris Baldick argues in his book, In Frankenstein’s Shadow. For Baldick (62), the “eloquent invisibility” of the monster ensures its more radical survival in the liberal conﬁnes of literary criticism. Yet, even in the profusion of literary meanings that give form and identity to the monster, strategies of limitation and exclusion still seem to function to contain the interrogative excess of monstrosity as it reﬂects on all institutions, literary criticism included. Frankenstein, distinguished by Baldick from its reproductions by means of an opposition of literary tradition and popular culture, does not, however, respect such boundaries since, for many, it is hardly “lit- erature” at all. Sensational Gothic ﬁction or a clumsy Romantic novel (Bloom 613), a “minor work” (Norman 408) that is “not one of the living novels of the world” (Grylls 320), Frankenstein occupies an un- stable place on the boundaries that separate “literature” and its values from second-rate ﬁction. It is a monstrous space, itself subject to the excessive effects of monstrosity. For Deleuze and Guattari (50) litera- ture is also a kind of monster, an “assemblage.” Composed of disjunctive parts and fragments, “literature” forms an amalgam of multiplicitous and heterogeneous positions, a form of writing that combines elements and upsets their autonomy, blurring and questioning the artiﬁcial dis- tinctions that construct its meaning. In this context of excess and transgression, it would be presumptu- ous indeed to adopt a position outside the play of those forces, a posi- tion that reﬁises to acknowledge its own investments, involvements and interests in the texts it reads. It would also be foolish since it would mark another attempt to restrict or recuperate the excessive and dan- gerous movements of difference that it analyses and is affected by, another Frankensteinian attempt at mastery perhaps. Instead, the theo- retical position adopted here, a product of a different French revolu- tion — the revolutions of structuralism and post-structuralism, forms something of a monster itself. As an amalgam or “assemblage” of dis- parate elements drawn from a number of French theorists, this paper is situated along lines of intersection and divergence between several the- oretical positions. Partially formed in the diverse conjunctions of and differences between various theories, the project attempts, not to re- strict or to conﬁne, but to open up possibilities and inhabit a frictional438 COMBINING PERSPECTIVES position that both resists closure and produces, in its engagements with revolutions and monsters, questions concerning the differences and power relations involved in politics, literature, theory and reading itself. Of the multiple and diverse theoretical utterances that have informed this paper, a few can be speciﬁed for their direct bearings upon this account of Frankenstein and the French Revolution. In the essays “Preface to Transgression” and “Language to Inﬁnity,” Michel Foucault considers the way that language displays its monstrous poten- tial to both set and transgress limits and engender a dangerous profu- sion of self-reﬂection and doubling. There are certain similarities between Foucault’s account of writing and Derrida’s description of deconstruction, in “Signature Event Context,” as a “double gesture, a double science, a double writing.” The doubling effects of deconstruc- tion demand a transgression of the limits imposed on writing by hierar- chical binary oppositions: deconstruction must “put into practice a reversal of the classical opposition and a general displacement of the sys- tem” (Derrida 195). Double gestures thus disturb the stability of oppo- sitions by activating the differences between one pole and its other. For Iacques Lacan, the construction of subjectivity in language also involves relations of doubling: identifying with its specular image in the mirror, identifying with the Other of language, the subject exists only in relations of difference and desire. Determined by the laws of the symbolic order, the subject is constructed by the effects of signiﬁcation and is also subject to the shifts, the displacements of desire, within the system of differences that is language. Constituting the limits of subjec- tivity and meaning, the differences and desires at work in language also transgress and exceed those limits. In and between language and the- ory, then, a space of reﬂections appears in a fragmented, mirrored, doubled and interrogative form, a space from which meanings multiply. A similar position is disclosed by the monsters that appear in revolu- tionary controversies and in Frankenstein. From this space of reﬂec- tions, this position of doubling and monstrosity, it becomes possible to generate different readings of Burke’s Reﬂections, radical responses to it and Frankenstein’s monsters and doubles. Burke’s Reﬂections on the Revolution in France (1790) exempliﬁes the diffractions involved in processes of reﬂection: his text casts its rather partial light on events in France and reﬂects back on the situation in England and upon its own modes of representation. Monsters prolif- erate among these reﬂections. Already a conventional image of the enraged and riotous mob, monsters are also used to signify the French National Assembly’s destructive capacity and the Constitution ofFRED BOTTING 439 Republican France (see Burke 279-80, 313). This written document is opposed to the unwritten “constitution” of 1688, which Burke sets up as the guardian of English liberty, tradition and good order. Indeed, everything in France is constructed as England’s other: “out of nature,” irrational, irreligious and illegitimate, the affairs of France form a “monstrous ﬁction” that displays the rightness of English “good order” as well as the obvious truth of Burke’s case (Burke 124). This is a most traditional deployment of monstrosity, one which, as Chris Baldick (10-11), following Foucault, observes, stages vice in order to vindicate virtue, presenting a cautionary tale that warns against the horrors of transgression. The “monstrous tragi-comic scene” per- formed in France describes a state of chaos, of revolving and uncontrol- lable extremes. In Burke’s words, “the most opposite passions necessarily succeed, and sometimes mix with each other in the mind; alternate contempt and indignation; alternate laughter and tears; alter- nate scorn and horror” (Burke 92-93). Revolutionary France, more- over, exists as a monstrous ﬁction in several other senses. It is the invention of “literary caballers and intriguing philosophers,” revolu- tionary alchemists whose evil imaginations conjure up and attempt to realize their own extreme and perverse ambitions (Burke 93). Exposing the deceptions of such conspirators in France and England, Burke attempts to forestall revolution in Britain, a revolution advocated pub- licly in the monstrous ﬁctions of radicals, like Richard Price, that iden- tify with the revolutionary slogans of France. The monsters constructed in Burke’s text as ﬁgures that afﬁrm the presence and value of good order in England betray a certain anxiety. Instead of afﬁrming good order they expound the need for, and thus lack of, good order. Burke’s ﬁnal metaphor is telling in this respect. His book, he humbly admits, comes from one who “when the equipoise of the vessel in which he sails, may be endangered by overloading it upon one side, is desirous of carrying the small weight of his reasons to that which may preserve its equipoise” (Burke 377). The ship of State in which he sails is already unstable, however, already under threat from forces which are beginning to exceed the bounds of liberal reason. To follow Stephen Blakemore’s 1988 analysis of Burke’s texts as writings deeply concerned about the maintenance of linguistic propriety and decorum within traditional orders of meaning, the ship might also be interpreted as a ﬁgure of conventional discourse upset by radical and revolutionary contestations and appropriations of meaning. These struggles raise the danger of the ship being cast adrift in chaotic seas of signiﬁcation. In the name of good order, reason, nature, liberty and440 COMBINING PERSPECTIVES tradition, Burke’s text becomes another monstrous ﬁction engaged in, and seriously affected by, the “revolution in sentiments, manners and moral opinions” that it sets out to control (Burke 175). Furthermore, the project of preserving “equipoise” has the oppo- site effect. Instead of quelling resistance and dissent, the Reﬂections provoked a great many vigorous and diverse responses, responses that extended, rather than contained, the dangerous proliferation of mon- sters. In his reply to Burke in The Rights of Man (1792), Paine attacks the former’s “marvellous and monstrous” method and goes on to criti- cize the system Burke defends, describing, in the process, the aristoc- racy as a monster (see Paine 202, 229). From radical perspectives, it is the social system that bears the responsibility for creating monsters. In her response to Burke in A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790), Mary Wollstonecraft castigates the system of hereditary property for making monsters of humans: “man,” she states, “has been changed into an artiﬁcial monster by the station in which he was born” (quoted in Butler 72-73). For William Godwin, writing a few years later, the “monstrous ediﬁce” of government by courts and ministers “will al- ways be found supported by all the various instruments for perverting the human character” (Godwin 439). The system that deﬁnes its own limits in the construction of mon- sters thus has its terms challenged and reversed. Burke, a maker ofmon- sters and a supporter of the system that creates them, is made monstrous himself. In this battle of meanings, the monster functions as a double-edged weapon and continues to reproduce at an enormous rate. The New Annual Register for 1794 stated that “the whole system of insurrection lay in the monstrous doctrine of the Rights of Man, and the Corresponding Society composed of the meanest and most despic- able of people.”1 Later, the followers of Godwin and Wollstonecraft were described by the Anti-]acobin Review as the “spawn of the mon- ster.”2 As an awful threat that was still at large, disseminating among radical writings, the designation of monsters legitimates their exclusion or suppression as ﬁgures dangerously opposed to national unity. The excessive threat of the French Revolution appears in its capacity to engender other revolutions. Indeed, the word “revolution,” Ronald Paulson argues, underwent a signiﬁcant change to mean an inversion, a half, or 180 degree, turn (Paulson 49-50). These turns initiate a mo- 1Cited by Kramnick, “Introduction” to Godwin 40. 2The Anti-]acobin Review, V (1800): 427; quoted in Sterrenburg 147.FRED BO-1'I'ING 441 mentum that shifts meanings from one pole to the other in a similar manner to the way that the monsters created by Burke challenged the authority of his order of meaning and appropriated and transformed his terms: monster-makers become monstrous in the very act of creating monsters or in the resistance of the monsters they create. In turn, sys- tems of authority attempt to return deﬁant radicals to their monstrous place. Like the Revolution in France which, in the name of liberty, over- threw tyranny only to repeat tyrannical practices, the revolving momen- tum of monsters and monster-makers releases forces that exceed the determining limits of binary oppositions and raise the possibility of other positions. Godwin, for example, rejects the need for any form of government other than rational and individual responsibility in the same text in which he rejects revolution as a useful means of establishing a free, benevolent and just society: “revolutions,” he contends, “are the pro- duce of passion, not sober and tranquil reason” (Godwin 252). But, unable to escape the violent and repressive logic of opposition that pro- duces the polarizations of revolution in the name of some ﬁxed and transcendent principle, Godwin’s argument returns to bellicose binary distinctions: “truth will bring down all her forces, mankind will be her army, and oppression, injustice, monarchy and vice, will tumble into a common ruin” (Godwin 462). The sober and tranquil language of rea- son cedes to the passionately rhetorical mode of prophetic and apoca- lyptic vision. Truth constitutes the authority and promise of victory as well as the cause of conﬂict, the ultimate booty as well as the bugle that begins the battle. Passion returns within the discourse of divine reason and revolutions rotate still more. The monster, a ﬁgure constructed to legitimate the exclusion or suppression of others, betrays their necessity and fecundity. Demarcat- ing the limits of a position, monsters, at the same time, possess the power to interrogate and transgress all limits. The excessive momentum of revolution and monster-making pow- erfully affects and is also transformed by Frankenstein. This focus on monstrosity and excess necessarily precludes detailed consideration of other readings of the novel’s relation to the French Revolution by Ronald Paulson, Lee Sterrenburg and Chris Baldick. Offering many important insights into the relationship between Frankenstein and the French Revolution, these critics, particularly Paulson and Sterrenburg, seem to identify a unity too ﬁrmly in the conjunction of text, history442 COMBINING PERSPECTIVES and biography through recourse to the name of the author. Divided between Burkean conservatism and her fan1ily’s radicalism, between love and political differences, it is the personal pole that is privileged in Paulson’s and Sterrenburg’s accounts. These readings are thus forced to contain or exclude the many excesses that surround Frankenstein’s production. The multiplicitous impact of the French Revolution, its polarization and dispersion of political positions, as well as the fascinat- ing but complicated biographical archive surrounding Mary Shelley, all contribute to an overdetermined set of pretexts for the novel and its interpretations. Frankenstein does not resolve these contradictions and intricate interconnections, but extends and entangles them. Echoes of British Revolutionary debates abound. Victor Frankenstein is educated at Ingolstadt, a town that is also the birthplace of the Illuminati, the secret society founded by Adam Weishaupt. The Illuminati, the Abbé Barruel argues in his conservative account of the French Revolution, were the conspirators responsible for revolutionary agitations. Frankenstein also embodies Burke’s fear of revolutionary alchemists or Enlightenment philosophers whose dangerous experiments upset all order by releasing dark and chaotic forces of evil. The monster forms the hideous result, a revolutionary mob that cuts a wake of terror across Europe. But the monster also speaks, not only to challenge his creator’s authority and question unjust human practices, but to claim recog- nition and human kindness. His argument, that “misery made me a ﬁend” (p. 94), echoes the radical descriptions of monsters as socially produced creatures. In opposing Frankenstein, then, the resistance of the monster constructs a relationship that doubles the polemics of Burke and the radicals, and invites a reading in which Frankenstein can be seen, not as a dangerous radical philosopher, but as a pastiche, or even a parody, of paranoid Burkean ﬁctions. Frankenstein’s het- erogeneous assembly of political positions makes many identiﬁcations possible, but refuses to specify a single, recognizable and dominant viewpoint. This is the signiﬁcant and divergent aspect of Frankenstein’s account of the French Revolution. Replaying and extending the struc- tures of reversal that emerge in revolutionary polemics, the novel also represents their totalizing desires, their invocations of some tran- scendent unity, whether it be Burkean good order or Godwinian ratio- nal truth. Robert Walton, the explorer whose letters begin the novel, sets out to discover the North Pole and the “wondrous power that attracts theFRED BOTTING 443 needle” so that he “may regulate a thousand celestial observations” and “render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever” (p. 28). The imagined unity of this world of “eternal light” excites Walton’s aspira- tions. Victor Frankenstein, similarly, aspires to metaphysical knowledge and imagines he can attain the unity and presence of a singular and priv- ileged pole of signiﬁcance beyond the bounds of binary oppositions: Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should ﬁrst break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs. (p. 58) Transcending human constraints, the superhuman creator envisages a world beyond difference in which his “new species” exists only to adore the master. But the others — death, darkness, women, bodies — on which Frankenstein depends in order to steal the secrets of nature and succeed in his illumination of life in full, are not effaced: “to examine the causes of life,” Frankenstein comments, “we must ﬁrst have recourse to death” (p. 56). In conjunction with many of the others Victor’s project aimed to efface, like women, bodies, sexuality and darkness, death returns with a vengeance in the dream that follows the animation of the mon- ster. As he wakes from his disturbing sleep of dreams, the creator sees the horrible form of his creation approaching him and he ﬂees from this inverted image of his aspirations. Frankenstein has not achieved the fullness of life and illumination that he projected: he has revitalized the forces of otherness which he hoped to efface. The creature he designed to be beautiﬁil is realized as an ugly and repulsive being. But then how could anything have lived up to the exorbitant ideals of the creator’s imagination? Frankenstein’s totalizing dream discovers its dependence on systems of difference as the human creator encounters the necessity of monstrosity when, wak- ing from his dream, he repeats the convulsive physical agitations that announced the ﬁrst stirrings of life in the monster. One turns into other; dreams become nightmares: “dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!” (p. 61). This subjec- tive upheaval is described in terms of a revolution: it is Frankenstein’s ﬁrst revolution.444 COMBINING PERSPECTIVES The momentum inaugurated by this overturning is not arrested, but rolls on through the course of the novel in an excessive play of dif- ferences that blurs all distinctions and questions all limits. In the next encounter between Frankenstein and monster, in the sublime setting of the Alps, more reversals occur: forced to be a listener, the creator is sub- jected to the monster’s demands for a mate that conclude the latter’s story. The shift in their relationship is declared, after Frankenstein has destroyed the half-ﬁnished female creature, when the monster exclaims: “you are my creator, but I am your master; — obey!” (p. 146). Ironi- cally, the creator has just performed an act of resistance. The ensuing struggle involves both ﬁgures in a tense dialectic in which they both try negatively to afﬁrm their lost authority: Franken- stein vows to kill his creation, while the monster destroys almost all the creator’s friends and relations. The subsequent confused and mutually sustaining pursuit speeds the novel to an end in which the life-giver attempts to persuade Walton to continue his destructive quest but fails and dies, while the creation announces his intention to kill himself on a funeral pyre at the pole in the only act of self-possession available to him. Fire amid ice, light in darkness, with this promised extinction of the ﬁrst and last of a new species the novel ends in an entangled assem- bly of opposites. The hopes of discovering a world of “eternal light” that began the novel have been overturned by the end, as Walton, reluctantly and disappointedly returning home, gazes at the monster becoming “lost in darkness and distance” (p. 189). Yet the novel does not simply describe the collapse of one pole of signiﬁcance into its other, light into dark, life into death, creation into destruction; it also questions the tensions between oppositional limits and engenders different positions, positions that can criticize and sub- vert, challenge and transform. From his position as a voyeur on the De Lacey family, the monster learns about the arbitrary system of differ- ences called language; he learns about gender differentiation and learns that humans have more than one identity, since signiﬁers have different effects. From this position, within and yet outside human orders, he is able to expose the inhumanity of human codes and values since they are the very things that deﬁne him as a monster. An artiﬁcial yet natural man, alive yet composed of dead bodies, benevolent and destructive, the monster shifts along the margins of many distinctions. His shifting and excluded situation produces the critical faculty that engenders an excessive array of disturbing effects. For example, when the monster frames the Frankenstein family servant, Iustine, for the murder of William Frankenstein, she is found guiltyFRED BOTTING 445 and sentenced to death despite her, and others’, testimonies to her in- nocent character. The verdict, however, for the reader who is aware of the existence of the monster, reﬂects upon the inadequacy and injustice of judicial institutions. Furthermore, the behaviour of Iustine’s confes- sor extends the reﬂections of monstrosity since he forces her to confess a lie: “he threatened and menaced,” Iustine tells Elizabeth, “until I almost began to think I was the monster that he said I was” (p. 83). The confessor’s actions reﬂect less on Iustine than the clerical institu- tions that make her a monster. The proliferation of monsters and the challenging and critical inter- rogations they provoke extend still further. Elizabeth, Frankenstein’s adopted sister and ﬁancée, deeply upset by Iustine’s ordeal, learns that vice and injustice are not the “imaginary evils” she thought they were. In her words, “misery has come home, and men appear to me as mon- sters thirsting for each other’s blood” (p. 88). A critique of masculinity as much as human inhumanity, Elizabeth echoes some of the monster’s own sentiments and goes on to question the possibility of making any distinctions at all in a world in which the limits and authority of any order seem so arbitrary. She exclaims: “alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thou- sands are crowding, and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss.” Swept up by the monstrous momentum of interrogative doubt, no bonds are secure and no position is safe. The uncontainable excess of monstrous otherness transgresses the limits set by any order as it operates along a position’s lines of demarca- tion and resistance. Structurally too, Frankenstein opens itself up to the forces of critical reﬂection that operate in its own fraught bipolar momentum. As a set of broken frames, the narrative encloses the mon- ster’s story within Frankenstein’s, the latter’s being surrounded by Wal- ton’s letters, letters that are addressed to his sister on the edges of the text: the reader is at once moved inward to a presumed center, the monster’s account of the De Lacey family, and outwards, to the absent addressee on the margins. But the story at the center fragments, dis- persed by the rage of the monster, while the monster, neither wholly inside and contained by the structure, nor completely outside and excluded from it, appears at the end to confront Walton directly. Inside and outside, center and margin, have their distinctions subverted by a novel in which the different speakers and writers also occupy the posi- tions of readers and listeners. But, in its reﬁisal of a dominant, authorial overview, the novel does not necessarily equivocate or compromise446 COMBINING PERSPECTIVES between the poles it identiﬁes and confuses. Walton’s ﬁnal situation, suspended uneasily between departure and return, success and failure, light and darkness, is divided in such a way that it perpetuates doubts and dilemmas and engenders further questions: the ship may be return- ing home, but his gaze still attempts to penetrate the darkness into which the monster disappears. The direction of the monster’s disappearance itself engenders doubled effects. Moving in an opposite direction to the middle-class reader to whom Walton is returning, the monster approaches another place on the fractured margins of the text, a position which contrasts with the comfortable and domestic situation in which the text’s absent reader, Mrs Saville, is constructed. Dividing the marginal and uncertain identity of the reader, the movement of the monster turns that position into a critical space of reading. Reading thus becomes dangerous and excessive. A space of passive reception, it is also a space from which resistance and transformation can begin. Readers, indeed, become monsters. As one alarmed critic of the enormous popularity of Gothic novels wrote: The class of readers, for whom this kind of entertainment is pro- vided, as if no longer capable of deriving pleasure from the gentle and tender sympathies of the heart, require to have their curiosity excited by artiﬁcial concealments, their astonishment kept awake by a perpetual succession of wonderful incidents, and their very blood congealed with chilling horrours.3 Upsetting the bounds of literary propriety with their insatiable appetites, readers of Gothic ﬁction eschew taste and decorum with their demands for more and more awful thrills. Novels were constructed in a similar manner to readers — as mon- sters. In 1796, a brief review of Matthew Levvis’s The Monk lamented the waste of the author’s talents on the production of a text so irre- deemably devoted to excess: Lust, murder, incest, and every atrocity that can disgrace human nature, brought together, without the apology of probability, or even possibihty, for their introduction. To make amends, the moral is general and very practical," it is, ‘not to deal in witchcraft and magic, because the devil vw-ll have you at last!’ We are sorry to 3Review of Count Roderic’s Castle; or, Gothic Times, Analytical Review 20 (1794): 489; cited by NapierFRED norrmo 447 observe that good talents have been misapplied in the production of this monster.“ Patently exceeding the bounds of literary propriety and taste, The Monk displayed its monstrosity and reﬂected that of the readers of Gothic romances. The origin for the threatening proliferation of those ﬁgures of excess— Gothic tales and their readers—was identiﬁed as Horace Walpole’s The Castle of Otranto. One commentary noted how “Otranto Ghosts have propagated their species with unequalled fecundity. The spawn is in every novel shop.”5 Like the phrase “the spawn of the mon- ster” that was used to describe the followers of Godwin and Woll- stonecraft, the “new species” of ﬁction created by Horace Walpole’s The Castle of Otranto reproduced at an alarming rate (Walpole 12). Frankenstein, too, imagines the creation of a “new species.” But his own “hideous progeny” resists, subverts and exceeds his control. Like Burke who, Paulson argues, constructed the French Revolution as a Gothic novel, and like Walpole, Frankenstein cannot limit the effects of his monstrous creation. Indeed, the demand for greater thrills and more excessive pleasures subjected authors and the literary establish- ment to the desires of their readership in a similar manner to the way that radicals demanded liberty and equality from the systems that ruled them. More than passive consumers, readers begin to possess, in their function within the necessary and dangerous conditions of production, a certain power. Consuming, constructing and demanding, they form signiﬁcant others, ﬁgures of difference crucial to the work of creation even as they exist beyond the determinations of authority. Reading positions, glimpsed and activated among Frankenstein’s unstable frames, betray their monstrous power. Neither inside nor outside the novel, necessary yet unknown, absent addressees that pro- duce powerful effects, readers cannot be contained by the limits of a single text. Inhabiting and generating textual contradictions, readers can identify and recognize themselves in parts of the text as passive addressees, but they can also resist such constructions and produce read- ings that attempt to decide Walton’s disturbing dilemma: they can priv- ilege Frankenstein or the monster. Furthermore, as the monstrous and marginal space engenders a surplus of meanings that cannot be limited ‘Review of The Monk, a Romance, The British Critic, 7 Inne 1796: 677. 5T. I. Matthias, The Pursuits of Literature: A Satirical Poem in Four Dialogues, Lon- don, 1797: 87, n. iii; cited by Napier448 COMBINING PERSPECTIVES by the novel’s broken frames, so reading positions might multiply and challenge the terms and patterns prescribed in textual representations to interrogate and reactivate issues of difference and power. Not merely subjected to or positioned by the effects of writing, the construction of readers within the text allots a certain power and resis- tance to acts of reading and offers subject positions which can be refused, adopted or, even, transformed. Who knows? The writer, for sure, does not. The possibility of adopting different positions, always available in the frictions of textual oppositions and differences, is the partial and yet powerful prerogative of that ﬁgure of potential excess, the reader. Readers always might, like the monsters of Gothic ﬁction and the French Revolution, follow the exciting and unknown lines of excess that operate within the limits in which they are partially con- structed, since reading always involves some differences and thus entails the possibility of monstrous literary and political transgressions.

CANON A term used since the fourth century to refer to those books of the Bible that the Christian church accepts as being Holy Scripture — that is, divinely inspired. Books outside the canon (noncanonical books) are referred to as apocryphal. Canon has also been used to refer to the Saints Canon, the group of people ofﬁcially recognized by the Catholic Church as saints. More recently, it has been employed to refer to the body of works generally attributed by scholars to a particular author (for example, the Shakespearean canon is cur- rently believed to consist of thirty-seven plays that scholars feel can be deﬁni- tively attributed to him). Works sometimes attributed to an author, but whose authorship is disputed or otherwise uncertain, are called apocryphal. Canon may also refer more generally to those literary works that are “privileged,” or given special status, by a culture. Works we tend to think of as classics or as “Great Books”— texts that are repeatedly reprinted in anthologies of literature — may be said to constitute the canon. Note: The deﬁnitions in this glossary are adapted and/ or abridged versions of ones found in The Bedford Glossary of Critical and Literary Terms, by Ross Murﬁn and Supryia M. Ray (© Bedford Books 1997). 45°GLOSSARY 451 Contemporary Marxist, feminist, minority, and postcolonial critics have argued that, for political reasons, many excellent works never enter the canon. Canonized works, they claim, are those that reﬂect — and respect — the cul- ture’s dominant ideology or perform some socially acceptable or even necessary form of “cultural work.” Attempts have been made to broaden or redeﬁne the canon by discovering valuable texts, or versions of texts, that were repressed or ignored for political reasons. These have been published both in traditional and in nontraditional anthologies. The most outspoken critics of the canon, espe- cially certain critics practicing cultural criticism, have called into question the whole concept of canon or “canonicity.” Privileging no form of artistic expres- sion, these critics treat cartoons, comics, and soap operas with the same cogency and respect they accord novels, poems, and plays. CULTURAL CRITICISM, CULTURAL STUDIES See “What Is Cultural Criticism?” pp. 396-409. DECONSTRUCTION Deconstruction involves the close reading of texts in order to demonstrate that any given text has irreconcilably contradic- tory meanings, rather than being a uniﬁed, logical whole. As I. Hillis Miller, the preeminent American deconstructor, has explained in an essay entitled “Stevens’ Rock and Criticism as Cure” (1976), “Deconstruction is not a dis- mantling of the structure of a text, but a demonstration that it has already dis- mantled itself. Its apparently solid ground is no rock but thin air.” Deconstruction was both created and has been profoundly inﬂuenced by the French philosopher of language Iacques Derrida. Derrida, who coined the term deconstruction, argues that in Western culture, people tend to think and express their thoughts in terms of binary oppositions. Something is white but not black, masculine and therefore not feminine, a cause rather than an effect. Other common and mutually exclusive pairs include beginning/end, con- scious/ unconscious, presence/absence, and speech/writing. Derrida suggests these oppositions are hierarchies in miniature, containing one term that West- ern culture views as positive or superior and another considered negative or inferior, even if only slightly so. Through deconstruction, Derrida aims to erase the boundary between binary oppositions — and to do so in such a way that the hierarchy implied by the oppositions is thrown into question. Although its ultimate aim may be to criticize Western logic, deconstruction arose as a response to structuralism and to formalism. Structuralists believed that all elements of human culture, including literature, may be understood as parts of a system of signs. Derrida did not believe that structuralists could explain the laws governing human signiﬁcation and thus provide the key to understand- ing the form and meaning of everything from an Aﬁican village to Greek myth to a literary text. He also rejected the structuralist belief that texts have identiﬁ- able “centers” of meaning, a belief structuralists shared with formalists. Formalist critics, such as the New Critics, assume that a work of literature is a freestanding, self-contained object whose meaning can be found in the complex network of relations between its parts (allusions, images, rhythms, sounds, etc.). Deconstructors, by contrast, see works in terms of their undecid- ability. They reject the formalist view that a work of literary art is demonstrably uniﬁed from beginning to end, in one certain way, or that it is organized around a single center that ultimately can be identiﬁed. As a result, deconstruc- tors see texts as more radically heterogeneous than do formalists. Formalists452 GLOSSARY ultimately make sense of the ambiguities they ﬁnd in a given text, arguing that every ambiguity serves a deﬁnite, meaningful — and demonstrable — literary function. Undecidability, by contrast, is never reduced, let alone mastered. Though a deconstructive reading can reveal the incompatible possibilities gen- erated by the text, it is impossible for the reader to decide among them. DIALECTIC Originally developed by Greek philosophers, mainly Socrates and Plato (in The Republic and Phaedrus [c. 360 B.C.]), a form and method of logical argumentation that typically addresses conﬂicting ideas or positions. When used in the plural, dialectics refers to any mode of argumenta- tion that attempts to resolve the contradictions between opposing ideas. The German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel described dialectic as a process whereby a thesis, when countered by an antithesis, leads to the synthesis of a new idea. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, adapting Hegel’s idealist theory, used the phrase dialectical materialism to discuss the way in which a revolutionary class war might lead to the synthesis of a new socioeconomic order. In literary criticism, dialectic typically refers to the oppositional ideas and/ or mediatory reasoning that pervade and unify a given work or group of works. Critics may thus speak of the dialectic of head and heart (reason and passion) in William Shakespeare’s plays. The American Marxist critic Fredric Iameson has coined the phrase “dialectical criticism” to refer to a Marxist critical approach that synthesizes structuralist and poststructuralist methodologies. DIALOGIC See Discourse. DISCOURSE Used speciﬁcally, (1) the thoughts, statements, or dialogue of individuals, especially of characters in a literary work; (2) the Words in, or text of, a narraﬁve as opposed to its story line; or (3) a “strand” within a given narrative that argues a certain point or defends a given value system. Discourse of the ﬁrst type is sometimes categorized as direct or indirect. Direct discourse relates the thoughts and utterances of individuals and literary characters to the reader unﬁltered by a third-person narrator. (“Take me home this instant!” she insisted.) Indirect discourse (also referred to as free indirect discourse) is more impersonal, involving the reportage of thoughts, statements, or dialogue by a third-person narrator. (She told him to take her home immediately.) More generally, discourse refers to the language in which a subject or area of knowledge is discussed or a certain kind of business is transacted. Human knowledge is collected and structured in discourses. Theology and medicine are deﬁned by their discourses, as are politics, sexuality, and literary criticism. Contemporary literary critics have maintained that society is generally made up of a number of different discourses or discourse communities, one or more of which may be dominant or serve the dominant ideology. Each dis- course has its own vocabulary, concepts, and rules - knowledge of which con- stitutes power. The psychoanalyst and psychoanalytic critic Iacques Lacan has treated the unconscious as a form of discourse, the patterns of which are repeated in literature. Cultural critics, following Soviet critic Mikhail Bakhtin, use the word dialogic to discuss the dialogue between discourses that takes place within language or, more speciﬁcally, a literary text. Some poststruc- turalists have used discourse in lieu of text to refer to any verbal structure whether literary or not.GLOSSARY 453 FEMINIST CRITICISM See “What Is Feminist Criticism?” pp. 296-305. FIGURE, FIGURE OF SPEECH See Trope. FORMALISM A general term covering several similar types of literary criticism that arose in the 1920s and 1930s, ﬂourished during the 1940s and 1950s, and are still in evidence today. Formalists see the literary work as an object in its own right. Thus, they tend to devote their attention to its intrinsic nature, concentrating their analyses on the interplay and relationships between the text’s essential verbal elements. They study the form of the work (as opposed to its content), although form to a formalist can connote anything from genre (for example, one may speak of “the sonnet form”) to grammatical or rhetorical structure to the “emotional imperative” that engenders the work’s (more mechanical) structure. No matter which connotation of form pertains, however, formalists seek to be objective in their analysis, focusing on the work itself and eschewing external considerations. They pay particular attention to literary devices used in the work and to the patterns these devices establish. Formalism developed largely in reaction to the practice of interpreting lit- erary texts by relating them to “extrinsic” issues, such as the historical circum- stances and politics of the era in which the work was written, its philosophical or theological milieu, or the experiences and frame of mind of its author. Although the term formalism was coined by critics to disparage the movement, it is now used simply as a descriptive term. Formalists have generally suggested that everyday language, which serves simply to communicate information, is stale and unimaginative. They argue that “literariness” has the capacity to overturn common and expected patterns (of grammar, of story line), thereby rejuvenating language. Such novel uses of language supposedly enable readers to experience not only language but also the world in an entirely new way. A number of schools of criticism have adopted a formalist orientation, or at least make use of formalist concepts. The New Criticism, an American approach to literature that reached its height in the 1940s and 1950s, is perhaps the most famous type of formalism. But Russian formalism was the ﬁrst major formalist movement; after the Stalinist regime suppressed it in the early 1930s, the Prague Linguistic Circle adopted its analytical methods. The Chicago School has also been classiﬁed as formalist insofar as the Chicago Critics exam- ined and analysed works on an individual basis; their interest in historical mate- rial, on the other hand, was clearly not formalist. GAPS When used by reader-response critics familiar with the theories of Wolfgang Iser, the term refers to “blanks” in texts that must be ﬁlled in by readers. A gap may be said to exist whenever and wherever a reader perceives something to be missing between words, sentences, paragraphs, stanzas, or chapters. Readers respond to gaps actively and creatively, explaining apparent inconsistencies in point of view, accounting for jumps in chronology, specula- tively supplying information missing from plots, and resolving problems or issues left ambiguous or “indeterminate” in the text. Reader-response critics sometimes speak as if a gap actually exists in a text; a gap, of course, is to some extent a product of readers’ perceptions. One reader may ﬁnd a given text to be riddled with gaps while another reader may view that454 GLOSSARY text as comparatively consistent and complete; different readers may find differ- ent gaps in the same text. Furthermore, they may fill in the gaps they find in dif- ferent ways, which is why, a reader-response critic might argue, works are interpreted in different ways. Although the concept of the gap has been used mainly by reader-response critics, it has also been used by critics taking other theoretical approaches. Prac- titioners of deconstruction might use gap when explaining that every text con- tains opposing and even contradictory discourses that cannot be reconciled. Marxist critics have used the term gap to speak of everything from the gap that opens up between economic base and cultural superstructure to two kinds of conflicts or contradictions found in literary texts. The first of these conflicts or contradictions, they would argue, results from the fact that even realistic texts reflect an ideology, within which there are inevitably subjects and attitudes that cannot be represented or even recognized. As a result, readers at the edge or outside of that ideology perceive that something is missing. The second kind of conflict or contradiction within a text results from the fact that works do more than reflect ideology; they are also fictions that, consciously or unconsciously, distance themselves from that ideology. GAY AND LESBLAN CRITICISM Sometimes referred to as queer the- ory, an approach to literature currently viewed as a form of gender criticism; See Gender Criticism. GENDER CRITICISM See “What Is Gender Criticism?” pp. 334–45. GENRE From the French genre for “kind” or “type,” the classification of literary works on the basis of their content, form, or technique. The term also refers to individual classifications. For centuries works have been grouped and associated according to a number of classificatory schemes and distinctions, such as prose/poem/fiction/drama/lyric, and the traditional classical divi- sions: comedy/tragedy/lyric/pastoral/epic/satire. More recently, Northrop Frye has suggested that all literary works may be grouped with one of four sets of archetypal myths that are in turn associated with the four seasons; for Frye, the four main genre classifications are comedy (spring), romance (summer), tragedy (fall), and satire (winter). Many more specific genre categories exist as well, such as autobiography, the essay, Gothic, the picaresque novel, the senti- mental novel. Current usage is thus broad enough to permit varieties of a given genre (such as the novel) as well as the novel in general to be legitimately denoted by the term genre. Traditional thinking about genre has been revised and even roundly criti- cized by contemporary critics. For example, the prose/poem dichotomy has been largely discarded in favor of a lyric/drama/fiction (or narrative) scheme. The more general idea that works of imaginative literature can be solidly and satisfactorily classified according to set, specific categories has also come under attack in recent times. HEGEMONY Most commonly, one nation’s dominance or dominant influence over another. The term was adopted (and adapted) by the Italian Marxist critic Antonio Gramsci to refer to the process of consensus formation and to the pervasive system of assumptions, meanings, and values — the web of ideologies, in other words — that shapes the way things look, what they mean, and therefore what reality is for the majority of people within a given culture. Although Gramsci viewed hegemony as being powerful and persuasive, he didGLOSSARY 455 not believe that extant systems were immune to change; rather, he encouraged people to resist prevailing ideologies, to form a new consensus, and thereby to alter hegemony. Hegemony is a term commonly used by cu..ltu_ral critics as well as by Marx- ist critics. IDEOLOGY A set of beliefs underlying the customs, habits, and practices common to a given social group. To members of that group, the beliefs seem obviously true, natural, and even universally applicable. They may seem just as obviously arbitrary, idiosyncratic, and even false to those who adhere to another ideology. Within a society, several ideologies may coexist; one or more of these may be dominant. Ideologies may be forcefully imposed or willingly subscribed to. Their component beliefs may be held consciously or unconsciously. In either case, they come to form what Iohanna M. Smith has called “the unexamined ground of our experience.” Ideology governs our perceptions, judgments, and preju- dices — our sense of what is acceptable, normal, and deviant. Ideology may cause a revolution; it may also allow discrimination and even exploitation. Ideologies are of special interest to politically oriented critics of literature because of the way in which authors reﬂect or resist prevailing views in their texts. Some Marxist critics have argued that literary texts reﬂect and reproduce the ideologies that produced them; most, however, have shown how ideologies are riven with contradictions that works of literature manage to expose and widen. Other Marxist critics have focused on the way in which texts themselves are characterized by gaps, conﬂicts, and contradictions between their ideologi- cal and anti-ideological functions. Fredric Iameson, an American Marxist critic, argues that all thought is ide- ological, but that ideological thought that knows itself as such stands the chance of seeing through and transcending ideology. Not all of the politically oriented critics interested in ideology have been Marxists. Certain non-Marxist feminist critics have addressed the question of ideology by seeking to expose (and thereby call into question) the patriarchal ideology mirrored or inscribed in works written by men — even men who have sought to counter sexism and break down sexual stereotypes. New historicists have been interested in demonstrating the ideological underpinnings not only of literary representations but also of our interpretations of them. IMAGINARY ORDER See Psychological Criticism and Psychoanalytic Criticism. IMPLIED READER See Reader-Response Criticism. INTENTIONAL FALLACY See New Criticism. INTERTEXTUALITY The condition of interconnectedness among texts, or the concept that any text is an amalgam of others, either because it exhibits signs of inﬂuence or because its language inevitably contains common points of reference with other texts through such things as allusion, quotation, genre, stylistic features, and even revisions. The critic Iulia Kristeva, who popu- larized and is often credited with coining this term, views any given work as part of a larger fabric of literary discourse, part of a continuum including the future as well as the past. Other critics have argued for an even broader use and under- standing of the term intertextuality, maintaining that literary history per se is too narrow a context within which to read and understand a literary text. When456 GLOSSARY understood this way, intertextuality could be used by a new historicist or cul- tural critic to refer to the signiﬁcant interconnectedness between a literary text and contemporary, nonliterary discussions of the issues represented in the literary text. Or it could be used by a poststructuralist to suggest that a work of literature can only be recognized and read within a vast ﬁeld of signs and tropes that is like a text and that makes any single text self-contradictory and undecidable. MARXIST CRITICISM See “What Is Marxist Criticism?” pp. 368-80. METAPI-IOR A ﬁgure of speech (more speciﬁcally a trope) that associ- ates two unlike things; the representation of one thing by another. The image (or activity or concept) used to represent or “ﬁgure” something else is known as the vehicle of the metaphor; the thing represented is called the tenor. For instance, in the sentence “That child is a mouse,” the child is the tenor, whereas the mouse is the vehicle. The image of a mouse is being used to represent the child, perhaps to emphasize his or her timidity. Metaphor should be distinguished from simile, another ﬁgure of speech with which it is sometimes confused. Similes compare two unlike things by using a connective word such as like or as. Metaphors use no connective word to make their comparison. Furthermore, critics ranging from Aristotle to I. A. Richards have argued that metaphors equate the vehicle with the tenor instead of simply comparing the two. This identiﬁcation of vehicle and tenor can provide much additional mean- ing. For instance, instead of saying, “Last night I read a book,” we might say, “Last night I plowed through a book.” “Plowed through” (or the activity of plowing) is the vehicle of our metaphor; “read” (or the act of reading) is the tenor, the thing being ﬁgured. (As this example shows, neither vehicle nor tenor need be a noun; metaphors may employ other parts of speech.) The increment in meaning through metaphor is fairly obvious. Our audience knows not only that we read but also how we read, because to read a book in the way that a plow rips through earth is surely to read in a relentless, unreﬂective way. Note that in the sentence above, a new metaphor —“rips through”— has been used to explain an old one. This serves (which is a metaphor) as an example of just how thick (another metaphor) language is with metaphors! Metaphors may be classiﬁed as direct or implied. A direct metaphor, such as “That child is a mouse” (or “He is such a doormat!”), speciﬁes both tenor and vehicle. An implied metaphor, by contrast, mentions only the vehicle; the tenor is implied by the context of the sentence or passage. For instance, in the sen- tence “Last night I plowed through a book” (or “She sliced through trafﬁc”), the tenor — the act of reading (or driving) — can be inferred. Traditionally, metaphor has been viewed as the principal trope. Other ﬁg- ures of speech include simile, symbol, personiﬁcation, allegory, metonymy, synecdoche, and conceit. Deconstructors have questioned the distinction between metaphor and metonymy. METONYMY A ﬁgure of speech (more speciﬁcally a trope), in which one thing is represented by another that is commonly and often physically asso- ciated with it. To refer to a writer’s handwriting as his or her “hand” is to use a metonymic ﬁgure. Like other ﬁgures of speech (such as metaphor), metonymy involves the replacement of one word or phrase by another; thus, a monarch might be re-GLOSSARY 457 ferred to as “the crown.” As narrowly deﬁned by certain contemporary critics, particularly those associated with deconstruction, the vehicle of a metonym is arbitrarily, not intrinsically, associated with the tenor. (There is no special, intrinsic likeness between a crown and a monarch; it’s just that crowns tradi- tionally sit on monarchs’ heads and not on the heads of university professors.) More broadly, metonym and metonymy have been used by recent critics to refer to a wide range of ﬁgures. Structuralists such as Roman Iakobson, who emphasized the difference between metonymy and metaphor, have recently been challenged by deconstructors, who have further argued that all ﬁguration is arbitrary. Deconstructors such as Paul de Man and I. Hillis Miller have ques- tioned the “privilege” granted to metaphor and the metaphor/metonymy dis- tinction or “opposition,” suggesting instead that all metaphors are really metonyms. MODERNISM See Postmodernism. NARRATIVE A story or a telling of a story, or an account of a situation or events. Narratives may be ﬁctional or true; they may be written in prose or verse. Some critics use the term even more generally; Brook Thomas, a new historicist, has critiqued “narratives of human history that neglect the role human labor has played.” NARRATOLOGY The analysis of the structural components of a nar- rative, the way in which those components interrelate, and the relationship between this complex of elements and the narrative’s basic story line. Narratol- ogy incorporates techniques developed by other critics, most notably Russian forrnalists and French structuralists, applying in addition numerous tradi- tional methods of analyzing narrative ﬁction (for instance, those methods out- lined in the “Showing as Telling” chapter of Wayne Booth’s The Rhetoric of Fiction [1961]). Narratologists treat narratives as explicitly, intentionally, and meticulously constructed systems rather than as simple or natural vehicles for an author’s representation of life. They seek to analyze and explain how authors transform a chronologically organized story line into a literary plot. (Story is the raw material from which plot is selectively arranged and constructed.) Narratologists pay particular attention to such elements as point of view; the relations among story, teller, and audience; and the levels and types of dis- course used in narratives. Certain narratologists concentrate on the question of whether any narrative can actually be neutral (like a clear pane of glass through which some subject is objectively seen) and on how the practices of a given cul- ture inﬂuence the shape, content, and impact of “historical” narratives. Mieke Bal’s Narratology: Introduction to the Theory of Narrative (1980) is a standard introduction to the narratological approach. NEW CRITICISM, THE A type of formalist literary criticism that reached its height during the 1940s and 1950s, and that received its name from Iohn Crowe Ransom’s 1941 book The New Criticism. New Critics treat a work of literary art as if it were a self-contained, self-referential object. Rather than basing their interpretations of a text on the reader’s response, the author’s stated intentions, or parallels between the text and historical contexts (such as the author’s life), New Critics perform a close reading of the text, concentrat- ing on the internal relationships that give it its own distinctive character or form. New Critics emphasize that the structure of a work should not be divorced from meaning, viewing the two as constituting a quasi-organic unity.458 GLOSSARY Special attention is paid to repetition, particularly of images or symbols, but also of sound effects and rhythms in poetry. New critics especially appreciate the use of literary devices, such as irony and paradox, to achieve a balance or recon- ciliation between dissimilar, even conﬂicting, elements in a text. Because of the importance placed on close textual analysis and the stress on the text as a carefully crafted, orderly object containing observable formal pat- terns, the New Criticism has sometimes been called an “objective” approach to literature. New Critics are more likely than certain other critics to believe and say that the meaning of a text can be known objectively. For instance, reader- response critics see meaning as a ﬁmction either of each reader’s experience or of the norms that govern a particular interpretive community, and deconstruc- tors argue that texts mean opposite things at the same time. The foundations of the New Criticism were laid in books and essays written during the 1920s and 19305 by I. A. Richards (Practical Criticism [1929]), William Empson (Seven Types of Ambiguity [1930]), and T. S. Eliot (“The Function of Criticism” [1933]). The approach was signiﬁcantly developed later, however, by a group of American poets and critics, including R- P. Black- mur, Cleanth Brooks, Iohn Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate, Robert Penn Warren, and William K. Wimsatt. Although we associate the New Criticism with certain principles and terms (such as the affective fallacy — the notion that the reader’s response is relevant to the meaning of a work — and the intentional fallacy — the notion that the author’s intention determines the work’s meaning — the New Critics were trying to make a cultural statement rather than to establish a critical dogma. Generally Southern, religious, and culturally conservative, they advocated the inherent value of literary works (particularly of literary works regarded as beautiﬁil art objects) because they were sick of the growing ugliness of modern life and contemporary events. Some recent theorists even link the rising popularity after World War II of the New Criticism (and other types of formalist literary criticism such as the Chicago School) to American isolation- ism. These critics tend to view the formalist tendency to isolate literature from biography and history as symptomatic of American fatigue with wider involve- ments. Whatever the source of the New Criticism’s popularity (or the reason for its eventual decline), its practitioners and the textbooks they wrote were so inﬂuential in American academia that the approach became standard in college and even high school curricula through the 1960s and well into the 1970s. NEW HISTORICISM, THE A type of literary criticism that developed during the 1980s, largely in reaction to the text-only approach pursued by for- malist New Critics and the critics who challenged the New Criticism in the 1970s. New historicists, like formalists and their critics, acknowledge the importance of the literary text, but they also analyze the text with an eye to his- tory. In this respect, the new historicism is not “new”; the majority of critics between 1920 and 1950 focused on a work’s historical content and based their interpretations on the interplay between the text and historical contexts (such as the author’s life or intentions in writing the work). In other respects, however, the new historicism differs from the historical criticism of the 1930s and 1940s. It is informed by the poststructuralist and reader-response theory of the 1970s, as well as by the thinking of feminist, cultural, and Marxist critics whose work was also “new” in the 1980s. They are less fact- and event-oriented than historical critics used to be, perhapsGLOSSARY 459 because they have come to wonder whether the truth about what really hap- pened can ever be purely and objectively known. They are less likely to see his- tory as linear and progressive, as something developing toward the present, and they are also less likely to think of it in terms of speciﬁc eras, each with a deﬁ- nite, persistent, and consistent, zeitgeist (spirit of the times). Hence, they are unlikely to suggest that a literary text has a single or easily identiﬁable historical context. New historicist critics also tend to deﬁne the discipline of history more broadly than did their predecessors. They view history as a social science like anthropology and sociology, whereas older historicists tended to view history as literature’s “background” and the social sciences as being properly historical. They have erased the line dividing historical and literary materials, showing not only that the production of one of William Shakespeare’s historical plays was both a political act and a historical event, but also that the coronation of Eliza- beth I was carried out with the same care for staging and symbol lavished on works of dramatic art. New historicists remind us that it is treacherous to reconstruct the past as it really was — rather than as we have been conditioned by our own place and time to believe that it was. And they know that the job is impossible for those who are unaware of that difﬁculty, insensitive to the bent or bias of their own historical vantage point. Hence, when new historicist critics describe a historical change, they are highly conscious of (and even likely to discuss) the theory of historical change that informs their account. Many new historicists have acknowledged a profound indebtedness to the writings of Michel Foucault. A French philosophical historian, Foucault brought together incidents and phenomena from areas normally seen as uncon- nected, encouraging new historicists and new cultural historicists to redeﬁne the boundaries of historical inquiry. Like the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, Foucault refused to see history as an evolutionary process, a continuous devel- opment from cause to effect, from past to present toward THE END, a moment of deﬁnite closure, a Day of Iudgment. No historical event, according to Foucault, has a single cause; rather, each event is tied into a vast web of eco- nomic, social, and political factors. Like Karl Marx, Foucault saw history in terms of power, but, unlike Marx, he viewed power not simply as a repressive force or a tool of conspiracy but rather as a complex of forces that produces what happens. Not even a tyrannical aristocrat simply wields power, for the aris- tocrat is himself empowered by discourses and practices that constitute power. Not all new historicist critics owe their greatest debt to Foucault. Some, like Stephen Greenblatt, have been most nearly inﬂuenced by the British cultural critic Raymond Williams, and others, like Brook Thomas, have been more inﬂuenced by German Marxist Walter Benjamin. Still others — Ierome McGann, for example — have followed the lead of Soviet critic Mikhail Bakhtin, who viewed literary works in terms of polyphonic discourses and dia- logues between the ofﬁcial, legitimate voices of a society and other, more chal- lenging or critical voices echoing popular culture. POSTCOLONIAL CRITICISM, POSTCOLONIAL STUDIES A type of cultural criticism, postcolonial criticism usually involves the analysis of literary texts produced in countries and cultures that have come under the con- trol of European colonial powers at some point in their history. Alternatively, it460 GLOSSARY can refer to the analysis of texts written about colonized places by writers hail- ing from the colonizing culture. In Orientalism (1978), Edward Said, a pioneer of postcolonial criticism and studies, has focused on the way in which the colo- nizing First World has invented false images and myths of the Third (postcolo- nial) World, stereotypical images and myths that have conveniently justiﬁed Western exploitation and domination of Eastern and Middle Eastern cultures and peoples. In an essay entitled “Postcolonial Criticism” (1992), Homi K. Bhabha has shown how certain cultures (mis)represent other cultures, thereby extending their political and social domination in the modern world-order. Postcolonial studies, a type of cultural studies, refers more broadly to the study of cultural groups, practices, and discourses - including but not limited to literary discourses — in the colonized world. The term postcolonial is usually used broadly to refer to the study of works written at any point alter coloniza- tion ﬁrst occurred in a given country, although it is sometimes used more speciﬁcally to refer to the analysis of texts and other cultural discourses that emerged aﬁer the end of the colonial period (after the success of liberation and independence movements). Among feminist critics, the postcolonial perspec- tive has inspired an attempt to recover whole cultures of women heretofore ignored or marginalized, women who speak not only from colonized places but also from the colonizing places to which many of them ﬂed. Postcolonial criticism has been inﬂuenced by Marxist thought, by the work of Michel Foucault — whose theories about the power of discourses have inﬂuenced the new historicism — and by deconstruction, which has chal- lenged not only hierarchical, binary oppositions such as West/ East and North/ South but also the notions of superiority associated with the ﬁrst term of each opposition. POSTMODERNISM A term referring to certain radically experimental works of literature and art produced after World War II. Postmodernism is dis- tinguished from modernism, which generally refers to the revolution in art and literature that occurred during the period 1910-1930, particularly following the disillusioning experience of World War I. The postmodern era, with its potential for mass destruction and its shocking history of genocide, has evoked a continuing disillusionment similar to that widely experienced during the modern period. Much of postmodernist writing reveals and highlights the alienation of individuals and the meaninglessness of human existence. Post- modernists frequently stress that humans desperately (and ultimately unsuc- cessfully) cling to illusions of security to conceal and forget the void on which their lives are perched. Not surprisingly, postmodernists have shared with their modernist precur- sors the goal of breaking away from traditions (including certain modernist tra- ditions, which, over time, had become institutionalized and conventional to some degree) through experimentation with new literary devices, forms, and styles. While preserving the spirit and even some of the themes of modernist lit- erature (such as the alienation of humanity and historical discontinuity), post- modernists have rejected the order that a number of modernists attempted to instill in their work through patterns of allusion, symbol, and myth. They have also taken some of the meanings and methods found in modernist works to extremes that most modernists would have deplored. For instance, whereasGLOSSARY 461 modernists such as T. S. Eliot perceived the world as fragmented and repre- sented that fragmentation through poetic language, many also viewed art as a potentially integrating, restorative force, a hedge against the cacophony and chaos that postmodernist works often imitate (or even celebrate) but do not attempt to counter or correct. Because postmodernist works frequently combine aspects of diverse genres, they can be difﬁcult to classify — at least according to traditional schemes of classiﬁcation. Postmodernists, revolting against a certain modernist tendency toward elitist “high art,” have also generally made a concerted effort to appeal to popular culture. Cartoons, music, “pop art,” and television have thus become acceptable and even common media for postmodernist artistic expres- sion. Postmodernist literary developments include such genres as the Absurd, the antinovel, concrete poetry, and other forms of avant-garde poetry written in free verse and challenging the ideological assumptions of contemporary soci- ety. What postmodernist theater, ﬁction, and poetry have in common is the view (explicit or implicit) that literary language is its own reality, not a means of representing reality. Postmodernist critical schools include deconstruction, whose practitioners explore the undecidability of texts, and cultural criticism, which erases the boundary between “high” and “low” culture. The foremost theorist of post- modernism is Iean-Francois Lyotard, best known for his book La Condition Postmoderne (The Postmodern Condition) (1979). POSTSTRUCTURALISM The general attempt to contest and subvert structuralism and to formulate new theories regarding interpretation and meaning, initiated particularly by deconstructors but also associated with cer- tain aspects and practitioners of psychoanalytic, Marxist, cultural, feminist, and gender criticism. Poststructuralism, which arose in the late 1960s, includes such a wide variety of perspectives that no uniﬁed poststructuralist the- ory can be identiﬁed. Rather, poststructuralists are distinguished from other contemporary critics by their opposition to structuralism and by certain con- cepts they embrace. Structuralists typically believe that meaning(s) in a text, as well as the mean- ing of a text, can be determined with reference to the system of signiﬁcation — the “codes” and conventions that governed the text’s production and that operate in its reception. Poststructuralists reject the possibility of such “deter- rninate” knowledge. They believe that signiﬁcation is an interminable and intri- cate web of associations that continually defers a determinate assessment of meaning. The numerous possible meanings of any word lead to contradictions and ultimately to the dissemination of meaning itself. Thus, poststructuralists contend that texts contradict not only structuralist accounts of them but also themselves. To elaborate, poststructuralists have suggested that structuralism rests on a number of distinctions - between signiﬁer and signiﬁed, self and language (or text), texts and other texts, and text and world — that are overly simplistic, if not patently inaccurate, and they have made a concerted effort to discredit these oppositions. For instance, poststructuralists have viewed the self as the subject, as well as the user, of language, claiming that although we may speak through and shape language, it also shapes and speaks through us. In addition,462 GLOSSARY poststructuralists have demonstrated that in the grand scheme of signiﬁcation, all “signiﬁeds” are also signiﬁers, for each word exists in a complex web of lan- guage and has such a variety of denotations and connotations that no one meaning can be said to be ﬁnal, stable, and invulnerable to reconsideration and substitution. Signiﬁcation is unstable and indeterminate, and thus so is mean- ing. Poststructuralists, who have generally followed their structuralist predeces- sors in rejecting the traditional concept of the literary “work” (as the work of an individual and purposeful author) in favor of the impersonal “text,” have gone structuralists one better by treating texts as “intertexts”: crisscrossed strands within the inﬁnitely larger text called language, that weblike system of denota- tion, connotation, and signiﬁcation in which the individual text is inscribed and read and through which its myriad possible meanings are ascribed and assigned. (Poststructuralist psychoanalytic critic Iulia Kristeva coined the term inter- textuality to refer to the fact that a text is a “mosaic” of preexisting texts whose meanings it reworks and transforms.) Although poststructuralism has drawn from numerous critical perspectives developed in Europe and in North America, it relies most heavily on the work of French theorists, especially Iacques Derrida, Kristeva, Iacques Lacan, Michel Foucault, and Roland Barthes. Derrida’s 1966 paper “Structure, Sign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences” inaugurated poststructuralism as a coherent challenge to structuralism. Derrida rejected the structuralist presup- position that texts (or other structures) have self-referential centers that govern their language (or signifying system) without being in any Way determined, governed, co-opted, or problematized by that language (or signifying system). Having rejected the structuralist concept of a self-referential center, Derrida also rejected its corollary: that a text’s meaning is thereby rendered deter- minable (capable of being determined) as well as determinate (ﬁxed and reliably correct). Lacan, Kristeva, Foucault, and Barthes have all, in diverse Ways, arrived at similarly “antifoundational” conclusions, positing that no foundation or “center” exists that can ensure correct interpretation. Poststructuralism continues to ﬂourish today. In fact, one might reasonably say that poststructuralism serves as the overall paradigm for many of the most prominent contemporary critical perspectives. Approaches ranging from reader-response criticism to the new historicism assume the “antifounda- tionalist” bias of poststructuralism. Many approaches also incorporate the post- structuralist position that texts do not have clear and deﬁnite meanings, an argument pushed to the extreme by those poststructuralists identiﬁed with deconstruction. But unlike deconstructors, who argue that the process of signiﬁcation itself produces irreconcilable contradictions, contemporary critics oriented toward other poststructuralist approaches (discourse analysis or Lacanian psychoanalytic theory, for instance) maintain that texts do have real meanings underlying their apparent or “manifest” meanings (which often con- tradict or cancel out one another). These underlying meanings have been dis- torted, disguised, or repressed for psychological or ideological reasons but can be discovered through poststructuralist ways of reading. PRESENCE AND ABSENCE Words given a special literary application by French theorist of deconstruction Iacques Derrida when he used them to make a distinction between speech and writing. An individual speaking words must actually be present at the time they are heard, Derrida pointed out,GLOSSARY 463 whereas an individual writing words is absent at the time they are read. Derrida, who associates presence with “logos” (the creating spoken Word of a present God who “In the beginning” said “Let there be light”), argued that the West- ern concept of language is logocentric. That is, it is grounded in “the meta- physics of presence,” the belief that any linguistic system has a basic foundation (what Derrida terms an “ultimate referent”), making possible an identiﬁable and correct meaning or meanings for any potential statement that can be made within that system. Far from supporting this common Western view of lan- guage as logocentric, however, Derrida argues that presence is not an “ultimate referent” and that it does not guarantee determinable (capable of being deter- mined) — much less determinate (ﬁxed and reliably correct) — meaning. Der- rida in fact calls into question the “privileging” of speech and presence over writing and absence in Western thought. PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM AND PSYCHOANALYTIC CRIT- ICISM See “What Is Psychoanalytic Criticism?” pp. 262-74. QUEER THEORY See Gay and Lesbian Criticism, Gender Criticism. READER-RESPONSE CRITICISM A critical approach encompassing various approaches to literature that explore and seek to explain the diversity (and often divergence) of readers’ responses to literary works. Louise Rosenblatt is often credited with pioneering the approaches in Lit- erature as Exploration (1938). In a 1969 essay entitled “Towards a Transac- tional Theory of Reading,” she summed up her position as follows: “a poem is what the reader lives through under the guidance of the text and experiences as relevant to the text.” Recognizing that many critics would reject this deﬁnition, Rosenblatt wrote: “The idea that a poem presupposes a reader actively involved with a text is particularly shocking to those seeking to emphasize the objectivity of their interpretations.” Rosenblatt implicitly and generally refers to formalists (the most inﬂuential of whom are the New Critics) when she speaks of suppos- edly objective interpreters shocked by the notion that a “poem” is cooperatively produced by a “reader” and a “text.” Formalists spoke of “the poem itself,” the “concrete work of art,” the “real poem.” They had no interest in what a work of literature makes a reader “live through.” In fact, in The Verbal Icon (1954), William K- Wimsatt and Monroe C. Beardsley used the term affective fallacy to deﬁne as erroneous the very idea that a reader’s response is relevant to the meaning of a literary work. Stanley Fish, whose early work is seen by some as marking the true begin- ning of contemporary reader-response criticism, also took issue with the tenets of formalism. In “Literature in the Reader: Affective Stylistics” (1970), he argued that any school of criticism that sees a literary work as an object, claim- ing to describe what it is and never what it does, misconstrues the very essence of literature and reading. Literature exists and signiﬁes when it is read, Fish sug- gests, and its force is an affective force. Furthermore, reading is a temporal process, not a spatial one as formalists assume when they step back and survey the literary work as if it were an object spread out before them. The German critic Wolfgang Iser has described that process in his books The Implied Reader: Patterns of Communication in Prose Fiction from Bunyan to Beckett (1974) and The Act of Reading: A Theory of Aesthetic Response (1976). Iser argues that texts contain gaps (or blanks) that powerfully affect the reader, who must explain464 GLOSSARY them, connect what they separate, and create in his or her mind aspects of a work that aren’t in the text but that the text incites. With the redeﬁnition of literature as something that only exists meaning- fully in the mind of the reader, with the redeﬁnition of the literary work as a cat- alyst of mental events, comes a redeﬁnition of the reader. No longer is the reader the passive recipient of those ideas that an author has planted in a text. “The reader is active,” Rosenblatt had insisted. Fish makes the same point in “Literature in the Reader”: “reading is . . . something you do.” Iser, in focusing critical interest on the gaps in texts, on the blanks that readers have to ﬁll in, similarly redeﬁnes the reader as an active maker of meaning. Other reader- response critics deﬁne the reader differently. Wayne Booth uses the phrase the implied reader to mean the reader “created by the work.” Like Booth, Iser employs the term the implied reader, but he also uses “the educated reader” when he refers to what Fish calls the “intended reader.” Since the mid-1970s, reader-response criticism has evolved into a variety of new forms. Subjectivists like David Bleich, Norman Holland, and Robert Cros- man have viewed the reader’s response not as one “guided” by the text but rather as one motivated by deep-seated, personal, psychological needs. Holland has suggested that, when we read, we ﬁnd our own “identity theme” in the text using “the literary work to symbolize and ﬁnally to replicate ourselves. We work out through the text our own characteristic patterns of desire.” Even Fish has moved away from reader-response criticism as he had initially helped deﬁne it, focusing on “interpretive strategies” held in common by “interpretive commu- nities”— such as the one comprised by American college students reading a novel as a class assignment. Fish’s shift in focus is in many ways typical of changes that have taken place within the ﬁeld of reader-response criticism — a ﬁeld that, because of those changes, is increasingly being referred to as reader-oriented criticism. Recent reader-oriented critics, responding to Fish’s emphasis on interpretive commu- nities and also to the historically oriented perception theory of Hans Robert Iauss, have studied the way a given reading public’s “horizons of expectations” change over time. Many of these contemporary critics view themselves as reader-oriented critics and as practitioners of some other critical approach as well. Certain feminist and gender critics with an interest in reader response have asked whether there is such a thing as “reading like a woman.” Reading- oriented new historicsts have looked at the way in which racism affects and is affected by reading and, more generally, the way in which politics can affect reading practices and outcomes. Gay and lesbian critics, such as Wayne Koestenbaum, have argued that sexualities have been similarly constructed within and by social discourses and that there may even be a homosexual way of reading.

SEMIOLOGY Another word for semioﬁcs, created by Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure in his 1915 book Course in General Linguistics. SEMIOTICS A term coined by Charles Sanders Peirce to refer to the study of signs, sign systems, and the way meaning is derived from them. Struc- turalist anthropologists, psychoanalysts, and literary critics developed semi- otics during the decades following 1950, but much of the pioneering work hadGLOSSARY 46 5 been done at the turn of the century by Peirce and by the founder of modern linguistics, Ferdinand de Saussure. To a semiotician, a sign is not simply a direct means of communication, such as a stop sign or a restaurant sign or language itself. Rather, signs encom- pass body language (crossed arms, slouching), ways of greeting and parting (handshakes, hugs, waves), artifacts, and even articles of clothing. A sign is any- thing that conveys information to others who understand it based upon a sys- tem of codes and conventions that they have consciously learned or unconsciously internalized as members of a certain culture. Semioticians have often used concepts derived speciﬁcally from linguistics, which focuses on lan- guage, to analyze all types of signs. Although Saussure viewed linguistics as a division of semiotics (semiotics, after all, involves the study of all signs, not just linguistic ones), much semiotic theory rests on Saussure’s linguistic terms, concepts, and distinctions. Semioti- cians subscribe to Saussure’s basic concept of the linguistic sign as containing a signiﬁer (a linguistic “sound image” used to represent some more abstract con- cept) and signiﬁed (the abstract concept being represented). They have also found generally useful his notion that the relationship between signiﬁers and signiﬁed is arbitrary; that is, no intrinsic or natural relationship exists between them, and meanings we derive from signiﬁers are grounded in the differences among signiﬁers themselves. Particularly useful are Saussure’s concept of the phoneme (the smallest basic speech sound or unit of pronunciation) and his idea that phonemes exist in two kinds of relationships: diachronic and synchronic. A phoneme has a diachronic, or “horizontal,” relationship with those other phonemes that precede and follow it (as the words appear, left to right, on this page) in a particular usage, utterance, or narrative —what Saussure called parole (French for “word”). A phoneme has a synchronic, or “vertical,” rela- tionship with the entire system of language within which individual usages, utterances, or narratives have meaning — what Saussure called langue (French for “tongue,” as in “native tongue,” meaning language). An means what it means in English because those of us who speak the language are plugged into the same system (think of it as a computer network where different individuals access the same information in the same way at a given time). A principal tenet of semiotics is that signs, like words, are not signiﬁcant in themselves, but instead have meaning only in relation to other signs and the entire system of signs, or langue. Meaning is not inherent in the signs themselves, but is derived from the differences among signs. Given that semiotic theory underlies structuralism, it is not surprising that many semioticians have taken a broad, structuralist approach to signs, studying a variety of phenomena ranging from rites of passage to methods of preparing and consuming food to understand the cultural codes and conventions they reveal. Because of the broad-based applicability of semiotics, furthermore, structuralist anthropologists such as Claude Lévi-Strauss, literary critics such as Roland Barthes, and psychoanalytic theorists such as Iacques Lacan and Iulia Kristeva, have made use of semiotic theories and practices. Kristeva, who is gen- erally considered a pioneer of feminism although she eschews the feminist label, has argued that there is such a thing as feminine language and that it is semi- otic, not symbolic in nature. She thus employs both terms in an unusual way,466 GLOSSARY using semiotic to refer to language that is rhythmic, unifying, and ﬂuid, and symbolic to refer to the more rigid associations redeﬁned in the Western canon. The afﬁnity between semiotics and structuralist literary criticism derives from the emphasis placed on langue, or system. Structuralist critics were reacting against formalists and their method of focusing on individual words as if mean- ings did not depend on anything external to the text. SIMILE See Metaphor, Trope. STRUCTURALISM A theory of humankind whose proponents at- tempted to show systematically, even scientiﬁcally, that all elements of human culture, including literature, may be understood as parts of a system of signs. Critic Robert Scholes has described structuralism as a reaction to “ ‘modernist’ alienation and despair.” European structuralists such as Roman Iakobson, Claude Levi-Strauss, and Roland Barthes (before his shift toward poststructuralism) attempted to develop a serniology, or semiotics (science of signs). Barthes, among others, sought to recover literature and even language from the isolation in which they had been studied and to show that the laws that govern them govern all signs, from road signs to articles of clothing. Structuralism was heavily inﬂuenced by linguistics, especially by the pio- neering work of linguist Ferdinand de Saussure. Particularly useful to struc- turalists were Saussure’s concept of the phoneme (the smallest basic speech sound or unit of pronunciation) and his idea that phonemes exist in two kinds of relationships: diachronic and synchronic. A phoneme has a diachronic, or “horizontal,” relationship with those other phonemes that precede and follow it (as the words appear, left to right, on this page) in a particular usage, utter- ance, or narrative — what Saussure called parole (French for “word”). A phoneme has a synchronic, or “vertical,” relationship with the entire system of language within which individual usages, utterances, or narratives have meaning — what Saussure called langue (French for “tongue,” as in “native tongue,” meaning language). An means what it means in English because those of us who speak the language are plugged into the same system (think of it as a computer network where different individuals can access the same information in the same way at a given time). Following Saussure, Levi-Strauss, an anthropologist, studied hundreds of myths, breaking them into their smallest meaningful units, which he called “mythemes.” Removing each from its diachronic relations with other mythemes in a single myth (such as the myth of Oedipus and his mother), he vertically aligned those mythemes that he found to be homologous (structurally corre- spondent). He then studied the relationships within as well as between verti- cally aligned columns, in an attempt to understand scientiﬁcally, through ratios and proportions, those thoughts and processes that humankind has shared, both at one particular time and across time. Whether Lévi-Strauss was studying the structure of myths or the structure of villages, he looked for recurring, com- mon elements that transcended the differences within and among cultures. Structuralists followed Saussure in preferring to think about the overriding langue or language of myth, in which each mytheme and mytheme-constituted myth ﬁts meaningfully, rather than about isolated individual paroles, or narra- tives. Structuralists also followed Saussure’s lead in believing that sign systemsGLOSSARY 467 must be understood in terms of binary oppositions (a proposition later disputed by poststructuralist Iacques Derrida). In analyzing myths and texts to ﬁnd basic structures, structuralists found that opposite terms modulate until they are ﬁnally resolved or reconciled by some intermediary third term. Thus a struc- turalist reading of Milton’s Paradise Lost (1667) might show that the war between God and the rebellious angels becomes a rift between God and sinful, fallen man, a rift that is healed by the Son of God, the mediating third term. Although structuralism was largely a European phenomenon in its origin and development, it was inﬂuenced by American thinkers as well. Noam Chom- sky, for instance, who powerfully inﬂuenced structuralism through works such as Reﬂections on Language (1975), identiﬁed and distinguished between “sur- face structures” and “deep structures” in language and linguistic literatures, including texts. SUPERSTRUCTURE See Marxist Criticism. SYMBOL Something that, although it is of interest in its own right, stands for or suggests something larger and more complex — often an idea or a range of interrelated ideas, attitudes, and practices. Within a given culture, some things are understood to be symbols: the ﬂag of the United States is an obvious example, as are the ﬁve intertwined Olympic rings. More subtle cultural symbols might be the river as a symbol of time and the journey as a symbol of life and its manifold experiences. Instead of appropri- ating symbols generally used and understood within their culture, writers often create their own symbols by setting up a complex but identiﬁable web of associ- ations in their works. As a result, one object, image, person, place, or action suggests others, and may ultimately suggest a range of ideas. A symbol may thus be deﬁned as a metaphor in which the vehicle — the image, activity, or concept used to represent something else — represents many related things (or tenors), or is broadly suggestive. The urn in Keats’s “Ode on a Grecian Urn” (1820) suggests many interrelated concepts, including art, truth, beauty, and timelessness. Symbols have been of particular interest to formalists, who study how meanings emerge from the complex, patterned relationships among images in a work, and psychoanalytic critics, who are interested in how individual authors and the larger culture both disguise and reveal unconscious fears and desires through symbols. Recently, French feminist critics have also focused on the symbolic. They have suggested that, as wide-ranging as it seems, symbolic lan- guage is ultimately rigid and restrictive. They favor semiotic language and writ- ing — writing that neither opposes nor hierarchically ranks qualities or elements of reality nor symbolizes one thing but not another in terms of a third — contending that semiotic language is at once more ﬂuid, rhythmic, unifying, and feminine. SYMBOLIC ORDER See Psychological Criticism and Psychoanalytic Criticism, Symbol. TENOR See Metaphor, Metonymy, Symbol. TEXT From the Latin texere, meaning “to weave,” a term that may be deﬁned in a number of ways. Some critics restrict its use to the written word, although they may apply the term to objects ranging from a poem to the words in a book to a book itself to a Biblical passage used in a sermon to a written468 GLOSSARY transcript of an oral statement or interview. Other critics include nonwritten material in the designation text, as long as that material has been isolated for analysis. French structuralist critics took issue with the traditional view of literary compositions as “wor ” with a form intentionally imposed by the author and a meaning identiﬁable through analysis of the author’s use of language. These critics argued that literary compositions are texts rather than works, texts being the product of a social institution they called écriture (writing). By identifying compositions as texts rather than works, structuralists denied them the person- alized character attributed to works wrought by a particular, unique author. Structuralists believed not only that a text was essentially impersonal, the con- ﬂuence of certain preexisting attributes of the social institution of writing, but that any interpretation of the text should result from an impersonal lecture (reading). This lecture included reading with an active awareness of how the lin- guistic system ﬁinctions. The French writer and theorist Roland Barthes, a structuralist who later turned toward poststructuralism, distinguished text from work in a different way, characterizing a text as open and a work as closed. According to Barthes, works are bounded entities, conventionally classiﬁed in the canon, whereas texts engage readers in an ongoing relationship of interpretation and reinter- pretation. Barthes further divided texts into two categories: lisible (readerly) and scriptible (writerly). Texts that are lisible depend more heavily on conven- tion, making their interpretation easier and more predictable. Texts that are scriptible are generally experimental, ﬂouting or seriously modifying traditional rules. Such texts cannot be interpreted according to standard conventions. TROPE One of the two major divisions of ﬁgures of speech (the other being rhetorical ﬁgures). Trope comes from a word that literally means “turn- ing”; to trope (with ﬁgures of speech) is, ﬁguratively speaking, to turn or twist some word or phrase to make it mean something else. Metaphor, metonymy, simile, personiﬁcation, and synecdoche are sometimes referred to as the princi- pal tropes. UNDECIDABILITY See Deconstruction.
